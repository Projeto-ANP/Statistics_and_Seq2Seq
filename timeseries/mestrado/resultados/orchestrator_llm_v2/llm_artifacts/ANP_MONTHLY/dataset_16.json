      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library in the tool response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's high disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of 0.3178. The best models vary per horizon, so maybe using a method that adapts per horizon would be good. The recommended candidates include both baseline methods and more complex ones like ridge stacking.\n\nSince the user prefers at least three candidates, I should pick a mix. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then, the best_per_horizon_by_validation could handle the varying performance across horizons. For a more sophisticated approach, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 might be effective, as it uses ridge regression with shrinkage. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 could be useful for weighting models based on their RMSE. However, the user might want a balance between simplicity and complexity. Let me check the score_presets. The balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Maybe selecting candidates that cover different approaches: baseline, selection, and stacking. So, baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. That covers different strategies and should provide a good balance. The score_preset would be \"balanced\" as it's a general approach. No need for force_debate unless there's a big difference, but with the given data, it's probably safe to not force debate. The rationale would be that these candidates offer a mix of simplicity, horizon-specific selection, and advanced stacking.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, horizon-specific selection for adaptive performance, and ridge stacking for robust weighted combination.\"}"
