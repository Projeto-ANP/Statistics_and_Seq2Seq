      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library and recommended_candidates from the proposer_brief tool's response.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's a fair amount of disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of around 0.63. The best models vary per horizon, so maybe a strategy that adapts per horizon would be good. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_single, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, inverse_rmse_weights, and ridge_stacking.\n\nThe user instructions say to select at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, the top ones are baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean_0.20, best_single, best_per_horizon, topk_mean_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nI should pick a mix of baseline, selection, and weighted methods. Maybe baseline_mean is a safe start. Then, best_per_horizon_by_validation could handle horizon-specific variations. For weighted methods, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 seems reasonable with shrinkage. Also, ridge_stacking might add some sophistication. But the user said at least 3, so maybe three: baseline_mean, best_per_horizon, and inverse_rmse_weights. Alternatively, include the trimmed mean as a robust option. \n\nWait, the recommended_candidates list includes baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean_0.20, best_single, best_per_horizon, topk_mean_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking. The score_presets are balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, robust_smape. \n\nSince the disagreement is high, maybe a combination of robust methods (trimmed mean, median) and a selection method. But the user wants multi-step strategies. The topk_mean_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights could be good. Also, the ridge_stacking might be useful. \n\nI need to make sure the selected_names are from the candidate_library. Let me check the names again. The recommended_candidates include \"baseline_mean\", \"robust_median\", \"robust_trimmed_mean_0.20\", \"best_single_by_validation\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\". \n\nSo, selecting three: maybe baseline_mean for simplicity, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for weighted averaging, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 for stacking. Alternatively, include best_per_horizon for selection. \n\nThe score_preset could be \"balanced\" as a default. The rationale should explain the choice. Let me check the example output. The example had baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k3 with params override, but the user wants me to select from the candidates. \n\nWait, the user's example output had \"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\"], but the instructions say to prefer at least 3. So I need to pick three. Let me go with baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. That covers baseline, weighted, and stacking methods. The score_preset is balanced. The rationale would mention diversity in approaches to handle high disagreement.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected diverse strategies: baseline_mean for simplicity, inverse_rmse_weights for adaptive weighting, and ridge_stacking for sophisticated model combination, to address high model disagreement and horizon heterogeneity.\"}"
