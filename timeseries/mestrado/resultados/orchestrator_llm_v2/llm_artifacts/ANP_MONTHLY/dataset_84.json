      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library provided in the tool response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and prefer at least three candidates. The score_preset can be chosen from the available options like balanced, rmse_focus, etc. \n\nLooking at the validation_summary, the best models per horizon include things like ONLY_CWT_catboost and NaiveMovingAverage, but those are individual models, not the combination strategies. The recommended_candidates have a mix of baseline, selection, and stacking methods. \n\nI should pick a few of the recommended candidates. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then maybe the best_per_horizon_by_validation and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 are good options. But the user wants at least three. \n\nThe score_preset: the balanced one is a good default. The rationale should explain why these were chosen. Maybe mention diversity in approaches: baseline, selection, and stacking. Also, considering the validation results and the recommended candidates. \n\nWait, the output_schema example shows selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user wants at least three. So I need to select three or more from the recommended_candidates. Let me check the candidate names again. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nSo selecting baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 would cover different strategies. Also, maybe include the inverse_rmse_weights one. But the user might prefer a balanced approach. \n\nI think the best approach is to select baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Then set the score_preset to balanced. The rationale would be that these strategies offer a mix of simplicity, per-horizon selection, and advanced stacking, leveraging both stability and adaptability.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for stability, best_per_horizon_by_validation for adaptive selection, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 for sophisticated ensemble learning.
