      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not to invent any. Also, I should prefer at least three candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there are five options here. The output schema example shows selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user wants at least three. \n\nI need to check which of these candidates are available in the candidate_library. The baseline_mean is definitely there. The best_per_horizon_by_validation is also in the recommended_candidates. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is present. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 are also in the list. \n\nThe score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. The user didn't specify a particular preset, so maybe \"balanced\" is a safe default. \n\nThe rationale should explain the selection. Since the validation_summary shows that there's some disagreement among models, maybe using a combination of baseline, topk mean, and inverse_rmse weights would be good. Also, the ridge stacking could add another layer. \n\nWait, the user's example output had \"baseline_mean\" and \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k3\" with a params override. But in the current case, the recommended_candidates have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Maybe selecting baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 as the three candidates. Alternatively, include the inverse_rmse and ridge stacking as well. But the user said to return at least three. \n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the first three are baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Those are three solid choices. The inverse_rmse and ridge stacking are also good but maybe the user wants the top recommended ones. \n\nSo, selected_names would be [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"]. The score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. The rationale would mention selecting these based on their performance and diversity in approach. \n\nI need to make sure not to include any candidates not in the library. All the selected names are in the recommended_candidates list. Also, no params_overrides are needed since the default parameters are already set. Force_debate is false unless specified, and debate_margin is 0.02 by default. \n\nSo the final JSON should have those three names, balanced preset, and the rationale explaining the selection.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, best_per_horizon_by_validation for adaptive selection, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to leverage ensemble diversity. Balanced preset prioritizes overall performance tradeoffs.\"}"
