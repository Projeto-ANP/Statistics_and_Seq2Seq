      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models per horizon vary. The disagreement metrics indicate high spread, so maybe using methods that handle disagreement well would be good. The recommended candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, inverse_rmse_weights, and ridge_stacking.\n\nThe user instructions say to select at least 3 candidates from the candidate_library. Looking at the recommended_candidates section, there are several options. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then, the best_per_horizon_by_validation and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 are selection methods that might perform well given the high disagreement. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 are weighted and stacking methods that could handle the varying model performances.\n\nI should check the score_presets. The balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Since the user didn't specify a preset, maybe \"balanced\" is a good default. Also, the force_debate and debate_margin parameters are set to false and 0.02 by default, which seems okay unless there's a reason to change them.\n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 as the initial candidates. But looking at the recommended_candidates, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 are also there. Maybe include those for a mix of methods. However, the user wants at least 3, so perhaps pick three from the recommended list. The output schema example shows baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k3, and others. But the user's example might have different parameters.\n\nWait, the user's example output has selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the instructions say to prefer at least 3. However, if uncertain, the fallback is to use baseline_mean. But given the tool output, there are several candidates. Let me check the candidate_library again.\n\nIn the candidate_library, there are multiple entries. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean_0.20, best_per_horizon, topk_mean_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. So selecting these three: baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Alternatively, maybe include the ridge_stacking as well. But the user wants at least 3, so perhaps three from the recommended list.\n\nAlso, the score_preset should be chosen. The balanced preset is a good default. So the final selection would be three candidates from the recommended list, using the balanced preset. The rationale would be that these methods handle high disagreement and leverage model diversity.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for stability, best_per_horizon_by_validation to leverage horizon-specific strengths, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 to dynamically weight models based on validation performance.
