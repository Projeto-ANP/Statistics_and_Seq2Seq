      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's high disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of 0.79 and a high p90 of 2.53. This suggests that models vary a lot in their performance, so maybe using a combination that averages or weights them could be better. The best models per horizon include some specialized ones like ONLY_CWT_catboost and NaiveSeasonal, but the recommended candidates are more about combining them.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the baseline_mean is a simple average, which is straightforward but might be sensitive to outliers. The robust_median and trimmed_mean are alternatives that handle outliers better. The best_per_horizon_by_validation selects the best model for each horizon, which could be good if there's a clear best model, but with high disagreement, this might not be stable. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 averages the top 5 models, which could smooth out some of the variability. The inverse_rmse_weights and ridge_stacking are more complex methods that assign weights based on past performance.\n\nSince the user wants multi-step strategies, maybe combining different approaches. For example, using a trimmed mean for robustness, then applying a stacking method. But the tool's recommended_candidates already include some of these. The score_presets have options like balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. The balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Considering the high disagreement, maybe a balanced approach is safer.\n\nThe user instruction says to select at least 3 candidates. From the recommended_candidates, I can pick baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. These cover baseline, averaging top models, and weighted approaches. The score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a general choice. Also, since there's high disagreement, maybe force_debate is not needed unless the scores are very close. The rationale should explain the selection based on the high disagreement and the need for robust methods.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected robust baseline (mean), top-k averaging for stability, and inverse-RMSE weighting to leverage model-specific strengths, given high model disagreement (relative spread p90=2.53) and heterogeneous horizon performance.\"}"
