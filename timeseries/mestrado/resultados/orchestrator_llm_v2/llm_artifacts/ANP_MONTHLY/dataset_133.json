      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models vary per horizon. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. These seem like solid choices.\n\nThe user instructions say to select at least 3 candidates from the candidate_library. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there are five options. I should pick three that cover different approaches. The baseline_mean is a good starting point as it's simple and robust. Then, the best_per_horizon_by_validation is a selection method that adapts per horizon. For a more complex approach, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 could be a good choice since it uses stacking with regularization.\n\nI need to make sure the names are exactly as in the candidate_library. The selected_names would be [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"]. \n\nFor the score_preset, the user didn't specify, so I'll go with the default \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. The other parameters like force_debate and debate_margin can stay as defaults unless specified. The rationale should explain the selection, mentioning the diversity of approaches and the use of recommended candidates.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robust simplicity, best_per_horizon_by_validation for adaptive selection, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 for regularized ensemble learning. All are top-recommended candidates showing strong performance across horizons.\"}"
