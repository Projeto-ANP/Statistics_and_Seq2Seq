      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library and the validation_summary to make informed choices.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models per horizon include things like ETS, DWT_rf, and NaiveMovingAverage. The recommended candidates from the tool include baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library. The recommended_candidates list includes several options. I should pick at least three. The baseline_mean is a safe choice as a starting point. Then, considering the best_single and best_per_horizon strategies, those are also good candidates. The topk_mean with k=5 and the inverse_rmse_weights with shrinkage 0.35 are more advanced methods that might perform better. Ridge stacking is another option, but maybe the user prefers simpler methods first.\n\nLooking at the score_presets, \"balanced\" is the default. I should check if any of the candidates have parameters that need overriding, but the user says not to change params.method. The tool's recommended_candidates already have the parameters set, so I can just select their names.\n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, and best_per_horizon_by_validation as the top candidates. Also, including topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for more diversity. But the user asked for at least three. Maybe pick the top three from the recommended list. However, the example output in the tool's output_schema shows selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user wants at least three. Wait, the user's instruction says to prefer returning at least 3 candidates. So I need to select three or more.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the first three are baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation. Adding topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 would make five. But maybe the user wants a balanced approach. The score_preset is \"balanced\" by default. So the final selection would be those three recommended ones. Also, the rationale should explain the choice based on the validation results and the presets.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_single_by_validation\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline and validation-based strategies for robustness and adaptability across horizons.\"}"
