      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon include things like ONLY_DWT_catboost and DWT_catboost. The recommended strategies seem to be a mix of baseline methods, selection methods, and weighted approaches.\n\nI need to select at least three candidates. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then, looking at the recommended_candidates, best_single_by_validation and best_per_horizon_by_validation are good selection strategies. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 are more advanced methods that might perform better. However, the user might prefer a balanced approach, so maybe include both a baseline, a selection method, and a weighted method.\n\nThe score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. The rationale should mention that these candidates cover different approaches: baseline, selection, and weighted averaging. Also, considering the validation results, using topk_mean with k=5 might be effective. But the user's example output includes baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k3, and others. Wait, in the recommended_candidates, there's topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Maybe that's better than k3. However, the example output uses k3. Hmm, but the user's example might be outdated. Let me check the candidate_library again.\n\nIn the candidate_library, there's a topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, which is in the recommended_candidates. So including that makes sense. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 are there. But the user's example output includes topk_mean_per_horizon_k3. Maybe the user wants to use k=5 as per the recommended. \n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Alternatively, maybe the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Let me check the validation_summary's best_per_horizon. The best models are things like ONLY_DWT_catboost, which is a single model. So using best_single might be effective. But the user wants combination strategies. So maybe the topk_mean and the inverse_rmse_weights. \n\nI think the best approach is to select baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. These cover different methods: baseline, averaging top models, and weighted by inverse RMSE. Also, the score_preset \"balanced\" is appropriate here. The rationale would explain that these strategies balance simplicity, ensemble averaging, and weighted approaches based on validation performance.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected strategies balance simplicity (baseline_mean), ensemble averaging (topk_mean_per_horizon_k5), and weighted aggregation (inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35) based on validation performance and diversity of approaches.\"}"
