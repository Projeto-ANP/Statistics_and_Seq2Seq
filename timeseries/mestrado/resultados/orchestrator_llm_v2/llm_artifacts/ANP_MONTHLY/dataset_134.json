      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and the candidate_library to select appropriate candidates.\n\nLooking at the validation_summary, there are several models listed with their RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID scores. The best_per_horizon section shows that models like DWT_rf, NaiveSeasonal, and FT_svr are top performers in different horizons. However, the recommended_candidates include strategies like baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nThe user instruction says to select candidate names from the candidate_library. The recommended_candidates list includes \"baseline_mean\", \"best_single_by_validation\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", and \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\". These are all valid names from the candidate_library.\n\nI need to pick at least three candidates. The baseline_mean is a safe choice as a starting point. Then, considering the best_single_by_validation and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, which are recommended. Also, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 could be good options. However, the user might prefer a mix of different types of strategies.\n\nThe score_preset can be set to \"balanced\" as it's a common choice unless specified otherwise. The rationale should explain the selection based on the validation results and the recommended candidates. I should make sure not to include any candidates not listed in the candidate_library and avoid changing the params.method as per the rules.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_single_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for stability, best_single_by_validation for potential single-model excellence, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 as a robust ensemble method.
