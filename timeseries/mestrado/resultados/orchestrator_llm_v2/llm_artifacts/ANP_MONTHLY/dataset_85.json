      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose a multi-step combination strategy based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library provided.\n\nThe validation summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models per horizon vary. The recommended candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. The score presets are balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape.\n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names from the candidate_library and choose a score_preset. They also mention preferring at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there are five options. But I need to make sure they are in the candidate_library. Let me check the candidate_library's candidates list.\n\nYes, baseline_mean is there. best_per_horizon_by_validation is also in the list. topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is present. inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is in the candidate_library under the weighted type. Ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is also listed under stacking. So those five are valid.\n\nBut the user wants at least three. Maybe pick the top three from the recommended_candidates. However, the example in the rules shows selecting baseline_mean, but the user might want more. Alternatively, the recommended_candidates include five, but maybe the best ones are the first three. However, the output schema example shows selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user says to prefer at least three.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"If uncertain, return: {\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\"], ...}\". But if I can select more, I should. The recommended_candidates have five, but maybe the user wants a balanced approach. The score_preset could be \"balanced\" as per the example.\n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Also, maybe include inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example only has one. However, the user says to prefer at least three. Let me check the candidate_library again to confirm the names.\n\nYes, all those names are present. So, I can select three or more. The score_preset is probably \"balanced\" as it's the default. The rationale should explain the selection. Also, the force_debate and debate_margin are optional, but the example sets them to false and 0.02.\n\nSo, the final JSON would include selected_names with at least three candidates from the recommended list, using the balanced score_preset. Let me make sure the names are correctly spelled and match the candidate_library.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, best_per_horizon_by_validation for adaptive selection, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to balance performance and stability across horizons.\"}"
