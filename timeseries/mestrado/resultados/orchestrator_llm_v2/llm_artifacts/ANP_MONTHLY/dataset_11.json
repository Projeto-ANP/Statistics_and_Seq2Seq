      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's high disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of 0.38. The best models per horizon vary, so maybe using a combination approach would be better than relying on a single model. The recommended candidates include both baseline methods and more complex ones like ridge stacking.\n\nSince the user prefers at least three candidates, I should pick a few that cover different approaches. Baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then, maybe the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 since it averages top models, which could handle the high disagreement. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 uses weights based on RMSE, which might be effective here. Ridge stacking could be another good candidate as it's a more advanced method. \n\nLooking at the score_presets, \"balanced\" is a good default. I should check if the selected candidates are in the candidate_library. Yes, all the names I'm considering are there. I need to make sure not to include any unknown names. Also, the params_overrides should be empty unless specified, but the user didn't mention any overrides. So the final selection would be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Wait, the output_schema example only has one selected name, but the user said to prefer at least three. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended_candidates list includes baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. So selecting three or four from these. Maybe pick baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Alternatively, include the ridge stacking as well. But the example output has only baseline_mean. However, the user instruction says to prefer at least three. So I should select three. Let me go with baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. The score_preset is balanced. No force_debate unless needed. The rationale would be that these candidates balance robustness, model selection, and weighted averaging to handle high disagreement.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for stability, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to leverage top models while mitigating disagreement, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 to dynamically weight models based on validation performance.
