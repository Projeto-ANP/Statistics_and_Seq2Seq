      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's a fair amount of disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of around 0.96 and a p90 of 1.39. That suggests that some models perform better in certain horizons than others. The best models per horizon include things like ONLY_CWT_rf, svr, catboost, etc. But since the user is asking for combination strategies, I should focus on the candidates provided in the recommended_candidates section.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, there are several options: baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nThe user instruction says to select at least 3 candidates. The baseline_mean is a good starting point as it's simple and a common approach. Then, considering the high disagreement, maybe the robust_median or trimmed_mean would be useful to mitigate outliers. Also, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 could be a good selection since it averages the top models for each horizon, which might handle the variability. Additionally, the inverse_rmse_weights and ridge stacking methods are more advanced and might provide better performance by leveraging model-specific strengths.\n\nThe score_preset should be chosen based on the priorities. The balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Since the user didn't specify a particular focus, balanced makes sense here. \n\nI need to make sure that the selected names are from the candidate_library. The candidates listed in recommended_candidates are all present in the candidate_library, so that's good. \n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, robust_median, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 as the three candidates. The rationale would be that these strategies balance simplicity, robustness to outliers, and leveraging top-performing models per horizon. The score_preset is balanced, and since there's some disagreement, maybe force_debate is not needed unless the margin is significant. The debate_margin is set to 0.02 as default.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"robust_median\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for simplicity, robust_median to handle model disagreement, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to leverage top-performing models per horizon while maintaining stability.\"}"
