      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the tool response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's some disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of around 0.14. The best models per horizon vary, so maybe a combination approach would be better than relying on a single model. The recommended candidates include both selection methods (like topk_mean) and weighted methods (inverse_rmse_weights) as well as stacking (ridge_stacking).\n\nSince the user prefers at least three candidates, I should pick a few from the recommended list. The baseline_mean is a safe choice as a starting point. Then, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are both good options for combining models. The ridge_stacking could add another layer of complexity. However, the output_schema example shows selected_names with baseline_mean and others. Wait, the user instruction says to select candidate names from the candidate_library, which includes those in recommended_candidates.\n\nLooking at the score_presets, there's a balanced preset. Maybe that's a good choice here. Also, the rationale should explain why these candidates were selected. The baseline_mean is a simple average, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 averages top models, inverse_rmse_weights uses a weighted approach, and ridge_stacking uses a more complex model combination. Including three or four of these would cover different strategies.\n\nWait, the output_schema example has selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user wants at least three. So I need to pick three from the recommended_candidates. Let me check the candidate_library again. The recommended_candidates list includes baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. So selecting three of these would be appropriate. Maybe baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Alternatively, include the best_per_horizon_by_validation as well. But the user said to prefer at least three, so maybe three is okay. Also, the score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. The rationale would mention combining different approaches for robustness.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline mean for simplicity, top-k mean for robust aggregation, and inverse-RMSE weights for adaptive model weighting.
