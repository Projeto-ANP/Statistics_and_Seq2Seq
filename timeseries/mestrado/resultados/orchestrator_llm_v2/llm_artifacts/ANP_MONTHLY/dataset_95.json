      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any new ones. Also, I should prefer at least three candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there are five options here. The output schema example shows selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user wants at least three. \n\nI need to check which of these candidates are available in the candidate_library. The baseline_mean is definitely there. The best_per_horizon_by_validation is also in the library. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is present as well. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 are also listed in the candidates. \n\nThe score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the user didn't specify a particular preset, maybe \"balanced\" is a safe default. The rationale should explain the selection. \n\nI should select three or more candidates. Let's pick baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Also, maybe include the inverse_rmse_weights one for diversity. But the example output only had baseline_mean. However, the user said to prefer at least three. \n\nWait, the output_schema example had selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but that might have been an example. The actual instruction says to return at least three if possible. So, I should select three from the recommended_candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The first three are baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Those are all in the candidate_library. \n\nSo, selected_names would be those three. The score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. The rationale could mention selecting top candidates based on validation performance and diversity in methods. Also, the force_debate and debate_margin can be set to default values unless specified otherwise. \n\nI need to make sure that the params_overrides are empty unless needed. Since the example had params_overrides for topk_mean_per_horizon_k3, but in our case, the selected candidates don't require any overrides. So, params_overrides would be empty. \n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have selected_names as the three candidates, score_preset as \"balanced\", and the rest as default. The rationale explains the selection based on the validation summary and recommended candidates.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected top-performing baseline, horizon-specific selection, and ensemble averaging strategies from validation-optimized candidates\"}"
