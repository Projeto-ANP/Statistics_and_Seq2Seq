      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models per horizon vary. The recommended candidates include baseline methods like mean, median, trimmed mean, as well as selection and weighting methods. The score presets are balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names from the candidate_library and choose a score_preset. They also mention preferring at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates section, there are several options. The baseline_mean, robust_median, and robust_trimmed_mean_0.20 are baselines. Then there's best_per_horizon_by_validation and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 as selection methods. Also, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 are weighted and stacking methods.\n\nSince the validation shows high disagreement (relative_spread_mean is 0.3778), maybe methods that handle disagreement well would be good. The robust_trimmed_mean could help with outliers. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 averages top models, which might stabilize the forecast. The inverse_rmse_weights uses weights based on RMSE, which could be effective. Ridge stacking might also be a good choice as it's a more advanced method.\n\nI should pick three candidates. Let's go with baseline_mean for simplicity, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for averaging top models, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 for a more complex approach. The score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a general choice. The rationale would mention handling disagreement and leveraging top models.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline mean for stability, top-k mean to leverage consistent performers, and ridge stacking to handle model disagreement inherent in high-disagreement scenarios.\"}"
