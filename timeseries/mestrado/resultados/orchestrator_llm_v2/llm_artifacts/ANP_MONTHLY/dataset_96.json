      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library provided in the tool response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any new ones. Also, they prefer at least three candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The first one is baseline_mean, which is a simple average. Then there's best_per_horizon_by_validation, which selects the best model for each horizon. The third is topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, averaging the top 5 models. The fourth is inverse_rmse_weights with shrinkage, and the fifth is ridge stacking.\n\nI need to pick at least three. The baseline_mean is a good starting point as it's a standard approach. Then, the best_per_horizon_by_validation could be useful since it adapts to each horizon. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 might be a good weighted approach. Also, the ridge_stacking could add another layer of complexity. However, the user might want a mix of different types: baseline, selection, weighted, and stacking.\n\nWait, the recommended_candidates already list these. The output_schema example shows selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user wants at least three. So I should pick three from the recommended ones. Let me check the scores. The score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, etc. The user didn't specify, so maybe default to balanced.\n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Alternatively, include ridge_stacking as well. But the user said at least three. Let me confirm the names in the candidate_library. Yes, all those names are present. The rationale should explain the choice, maybe mentioning diversity in approaches. Also, set the score_preset to balanced as it's a common choice. No need for force_debate unless there's a close call, but the tool's validation_summary shows some spread, so maybe not. The debate_margin is 0.02 by default. Alright, that should cover it.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, horizon-specific selection for adaptability, and weighted ensemble to leverage model-specific strengths while mitigating overfitting through shrinkage.\"}"
