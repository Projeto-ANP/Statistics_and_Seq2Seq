      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that ETS, NaiveSeasonal, and other models have varying RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID scores. The best_per_horizon_by_validation is recommended, which selects the best model for each horizon. Also, the topk_mean with k=5 averages the top 5 models, which might balance performance. The inverse_rmse_weights and ridge stacking are more complex methods that could potentially improve accuracy by combining models with weights.\n\nSince the user prefers at least 3 candidates, I should pick three from the recommended ones. The baseline_mean is a safe choice as a starting point. Then, best_per_horizon_by_validation and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 are both selection-based methods. Adding the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 would introduce a weighted approach. However, looking at the score_presets, the balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE and SMAPE, which might align with the topk_mean and inverse_rmse methods. \n\nWait, the user instruction says to select names from the candidate_library. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. So I can choose three of these. Let me check the parameters. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 uses top_k=5, which is in the candidate_library. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is also there. Ridge stacking is another option. \n\nConsidering the score_preset, \"balanced\" is a good default. The rationale should mention selecting top performers and balancing accuracy and robustness. So the selected_names would be baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Alternatively, including the inverse_rmse_weights might add diversity. But the user might prefer a mix of selection and weighting methods. Let me confirm the names are in the candidate_library. Yes, all those names are present. So the final selection would be those three, with the balanced score_preset.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline aggregation, per-horizon model selection, and top-k averaging to balance robustness and adaptability across horizons\"}"
