      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library provided.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models per horizon include things like DWT_catboost, ETS, and NaiveSeasonal. The recommended candidates from the tool include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library. The output JSON needs selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale. The example given uses \"baseline_mean\" as a default. \n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, there are five suggested. The user wants at least three candidates. The score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the tool's recommended_candidates include a mix of baseline, selection, and stacking methods, maybe choosing a balanced approach makes sense here.\n\nI should pick three candidates from the recommended list. Let's check the names again. The recommended_candidates are baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nSelecting baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. The score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. The rationale would be that these strategies balance simplicity, model selection, and stacking for robustness. \n\nI need to make sure that the selected names are in the candidate_library. Checking the candidate_library's candidates list, yes, all these names are present. Also, params_overrides might not be needed unless specified, but the example had one. However, the user didn't mention overriding parameters, so maybe leave params_overrides as empty. \n\nWait, the example had \"params_overrides\" with a topk_mean_per_horizon_k3. But in our case, the selected candidates don't have parameters that need overriding. The tool's recommended_candidates already have their parameters set. So maybe params_overrides can be an empty object. \n\nSo the final JSON would have selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], score_preset as \"balanced\", and rationale explaining the choice. Also, force_debate is false by default, and debate_margin is 0.02 as per the example.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Balanced selection combining simplicity (baseline_mean), adaptive model selection (best_per_horizon), and robust ensemble learning (ridge_stacking) to handle horizon heterogeneity\"}"
