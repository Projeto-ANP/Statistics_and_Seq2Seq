      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose a multi-step combination strategy based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models per horizon include things like catboost, CWT_svr, DWT_rf, and FT_svr. The disagreement metrics indicate high relative spread, so models vary a lot in their performance. The recommended candidates from the tool include baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, inverse_rmse_weights, and ridge_stacking.\n\nThe user instructions say to select candidates from the candidate_library and choose a score_preset. The output needs to be JSON with selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the tool suggests baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean_0.20, best_per_horizon, topk_mean_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. These are good candidates because they cover different approaches: baselines, selection methods, weighted averages, and stacking.\n\nFor the score_preset, the balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Since the validation shows high disagreement, maybe a balanced approach is better to not overemphasize any single metric. Alternatively, direction_focus might be good if direction accuracy is important, but the user didn't specify. The default is balanced, so that's safe.\n\nI need to pick at least three candidates. Let's go with baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. These cover a baseline, a selection method, and a stacking method. Also, including inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 could add another weighted approach. But the user might prefer fewer candidates. Wait, the instructions say to prefer at least three. Let me check the candidate_library again.\n\nThe candidate_library has \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", and \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\". So selecting these four would be good. However, the output example shows selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user wants at least three. Maybe the user wants a mix of different types.\n\nWait, the user's example output has \"baseline_mean\" but the instructions say to prefer at least three. So I should select three or more. Let me pick baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Also, maybe include inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. But the example shows only one, but the user says to prefer at least three. So I'll go with three.\n\nThe score_preset is balanced. The rationale should explain the selection. Since there's high disagreement, using a combination of baseline, selection, and stacking methods makes sense. Also, the force_debate is false unless specified, and debate_margin is 0.02 by default.\n\nSo the JSON would have selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], score_preset as \"balanced\", and the rationale explaining the choice.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for stability, best_per_horizon_by_validation to leverage per-horizon model strengths, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 for adaptive weighted combination. Balanced preset accounts for RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and directional accuracy given high model disagreement.\"}"
