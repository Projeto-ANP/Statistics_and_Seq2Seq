      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models per horizon vary. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library. The output JSON needs selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale. \n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the top ones are baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Also, there's inverse_rmse_weights and ridge_stacking. Since the user prefers at least 3 candidates, I should pick three from these. \n\nThe score_preset can be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. The rationale should explain the selection. I need to make sure not to include any names not in the candidate_library. Let me check the names again. Yes, baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 are all there. Also, maybe include inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 as a fourth. \n\nWait, the example in the rules shows selected_names with [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user prefers at least 3. So I should select three or more. Let me go with baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The params_overrides might not be needed unless specified, but the example has an override. However, the user didn't mention any overrides, so maybe leave params_overrides as empty. \n\nThe score_preset is \"balanced\" as per the example. The rationale could be that these candidates balance simplicity, selection based on validation, and averaging top models. That makes sense. I need to ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted with the selected names and other parameters.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline mean for stability, per-horizon best model selection for adaptability, and top-5 mean for robustness against model-specific failures.\"}"
