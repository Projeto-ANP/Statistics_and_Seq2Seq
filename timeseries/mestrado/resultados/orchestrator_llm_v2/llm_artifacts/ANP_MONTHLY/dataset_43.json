      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any new ones. Also, they prefer at least three candidates. The output JSON needs to have selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, baseline_mean is a good starting point as it's a simple baseline. Then, best_per_horizon_by_validation and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 are both selection methods that might perform well. The inverse_rmse_weights and ridge_stacking are more complex methods that could add value. However, the user might want a mix of different approaches.\n\nThe score_preset options are balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the validation_summary shows that RMSE is a key metric, maybe \"rmse_focus\" is appropriate. But the recommended_candidates include methods that might balance different metrics. However, the user didn't specify a preference, so maybe \"balanced\" is safer.\n\nI need to make sure that the selected_names are from the candidate_library. The recommended_candidates list includes baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. So selecting three of these would be good. Let's pick baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Alternatively, maybe include the ridge_stacking as well. But the user said at least three, so three is okay.\n\nWait, the output example in the tool response shows selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user wants at least three. So I need to select three or more. Let me check the candidate_library again. The recommended_candidates include five, so I can pick three from there. Maybe baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, the score_preset could be \"balanced\" as a default.\n\nParams_overrides: The example shows an override for topk_mean_per_horizon_k3, but in our case, maybe there's no need unless specified. The user didn't mention any overrides, so maybe leave params_overrides as empty.\n\nForce_debate and debate_margin: The example sets force_debate to false and debate_margin to 0.02. Unless there's a reason to debate, which there isn't here, so keep those as default.\n\nRationale: Should be a short text explaining the selection. Maybe something like \"Selected baseline, per-horizon best model selection, and inverse RMSE weighted approach for balance and robustness.\"\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON would have selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], score_preset as \"balanced\", and the other fields as default.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline, per-horizon best model selection, and inverse RMSE weighted approach for balance and robustness\"}"
