      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models per horizon include things like ONLY_DWT_catboost, DWT_rf, THETA, ETS, etc. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library. The recommended_candidates are part of that library, so I can use those. The output needs to be JSON with selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the top ones are baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. The user wants at least 3 candidates. Let me pick the top three from the recommended list. \n\nBaseline_mean is a good starting point as it's a simple average. Then best_per_horizon_by_validation, which selects the best model for each horizon. Third, maybe topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, which averages the top 5 models. \n\nFor the score_preset, the tool has options like balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the user didn't specify, maybe \"balanced\" is a safe choice. \n\nParams_overrides: The user might want to adjust parameters, but the example shows params_overrides as empty. Unless there's a specific reason to change, maybe leave it as default. \n\nForce_debate and debate_margin: The example sets force_debate to false and debate_margin to 0.02. Unless there's a need for debate, which isn't indicated here, keep those as default. \n\nRationale: Should explain the selection. Maybe mention that baseline_mean is a simple approach, best_per_horizon leverages past validation, and topk_mean combines top models for robustness. \n\nWait, the user said to prefer returning at least 3 candidates. The recommended_candidates list has five, so selecting three from there. Let me check the names again. The selected_names should be from the candidate_library.candidates. The recommended_candidates are part of that, so it's okay. \n\nSo the final JSON would have selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], score_preset as \"balanced\", and the rationale explaining the choices.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for simplicity, best_per_horizon_by_validation for adaptive model selection, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to leverage ensemble robustness. Balanced preset prioritizes overall performance tradeoffs.\"}"
