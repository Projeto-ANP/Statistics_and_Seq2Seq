      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's some disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of around 0.228. The best models per horizon vary, so maybe a combination approach would be better than relying on a single model. The recommended candidates include both selection methods (like topk_mean) and weighted methods (inverse_rmse_weights) as well as stacking (ridge_stacking).\n\nSince the user wants at least three candidates, I should pick a few that cover different approaches. The baseline_mean is a good starting point as it's simple and robust. Then, the best_per_horizon_by_validation could be useful for selecting the best model per horizon, which might perform well given the varying best models. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is a weighted approach that could combine multiple models effectively. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 might add another layer of complexity by using ridge regression.\n\nLooking at the score_presets, \"balanced\" seems appropriate here as it gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. The user didn't specify a particular focus, so balanced is a safe choice. I should make sure not to include any candidates not in the candidate_library. The rationale should mention the diversity of approaches and the balanced scoring.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, best_per_horizon_by_validation for adaptive selection, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for weighted ensemble.
