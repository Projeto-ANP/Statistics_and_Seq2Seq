      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's high disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of 0.466. The best models per horizon include things like ONLY_CWT_rf and CWT_rf. Since there's high disagreement, maybe using a method that combines multiple models would be better than relying on a single one. The recommended candidates include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, which averages the top 5 models per horizon. That could help mitigate the disagreement.\n\nAlso, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 uses weights based on RMSE, which might give more importance to models with lower error. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is a stacking method that could capture more complex relationships. Including both these methods might cover different aspects of the model performance.\n\nThe score_presets have options like balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the user didn't specify a preference, maybe going with the balanced preset is a safe choice. It gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID, which seems reasonable given the mixed performance metrics.\n\nI should select at least three candidates. Let's pick topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. These are all from the recommended_candidates and address different strategies: averaging top models, weighting by RMSE, and stacking. That should provide a good mix. Also, including the baseline_mean as a conservative option might be useful, but the user said to prefer at least three. Wait, the example in the rules shows selected_names with [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user wants at least three. So maybe include three from the recommended ones. Let me check the candidate_library again to make sure their names are correct. Yes, those three are present. So the selected_names would be those three. The params_overrides might not be needed unless specified, but the user didn't mention any. So params_overrides is empty. The score_preset is balanced. Force_debate is false unless there's a reason to debate, but with the given info, it's probably not needed. The rationale would explain the selection based on high disagreement and the need for robust methods.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected top-k averaging, inverse-RMSE weighting, and ridge stacking to address high model disagreement (relative spread mean 0.466) while leveraging validated robust methods from recommended_candidates.\"}"
