      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's high disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of ~49.5% and p90 of 63.1%. This suggests that models vary a lot in their performance, so strategies that can handle this disagreement might be better. The best_per_horizon_by_validation and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 are selection methods that could help by picking the best models for each horizon or averaging top performers. The inverse_rmse_weights and ridge_stacking are weighted methods that might adapt better to the varying performance.\n\nSince the user prefers at least 3 candidates, I should select a mix of baseline, selection, and weighted methods. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. The best_per_horizon_by_validation and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 are good selection strategies. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is a weighted method that uses shrinkage, which might be effective given the high disagreement. Ridge_stacking could also be a strong candidate as it uses a more sophisticated model combination.\n\nFor the score_preset, the balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, and others. Considering the high disagreement, maybe a direction_focus preset would be better to emphasize POCID, but the user didn't specify. The default is balanced, so I'll go with that unless there's a reason to change. The rationale should mention the high disagreement and the selection of strategies to handle it.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for stability, best_per_horizon_by_validation to leverage horizon-specific strengths, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 to adaptively weight models based on validation performance.
