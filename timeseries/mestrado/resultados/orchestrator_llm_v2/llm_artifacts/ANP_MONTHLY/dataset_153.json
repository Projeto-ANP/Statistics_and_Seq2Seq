      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library provided.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models vary per horizon. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. These seem like good candidates because they are recommended and have different approaches.\n\nI need to select at least three candidates. The baseline_mean is a safe choice as a starting point. Then, the best_per_horizon_by_validation is another recommended one, which selects the best model for each horizon. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 averages the top 5 models, which might balance performance. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights and ridge stacking are more complex methods that could potentially perform better but might be riskier with few windows. However, since the user mentioned preferring at least three, maybe pick the first three recommended ones: baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. \n\nThe score_preset should be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice unless specified otherwise. The rationale would be that these candidates offer a mix of baseline, selection-based, and averaging strategies, covering different approaches to combination. I should make sure not to include any candidates not in the library and follow the rules strictly.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline, per-horizon selection, and top-k averaging strategies to balance robustness and adaptability across horizons\"}"
