      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models vary per horizon. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names from the candidate_library and choose a score_preset. The output JSON needs selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the top ones are baseline_mean, best_single, best_per_horizon, topk_mean_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking. Since the user prefers at least 3 candidates, I should pick three from these. \n\nThe score_presets available are balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. The balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Considering the validation results, maybe balanced is a safe choice here.\n\nParams_overrides: The user didn't specify any, so maybe leave it as empty unless needed. The example in the output_schema has a params_overrides for topk_mean_per_horizon_k3, but since the user hasn't mentioned any overrides, perhaps it's better to leave it as {}.\n\nForce_debate and debate_margin: The default is false and 0.02. Unless there's a reason to debate, which there isn't here, keep them as default.\n\nRationale: Should be a short text explaining the selection. Maybe mention selecting top candidates from recommended list with balanced scoring.\n\nSo, the selected_names could be baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. These are from the recommended_candidates and cover different approaches (baseline, selection, weighted). \n\nCheck if these names exist in the candidate_library. Yes, they are there. \n\nThus, the JSON would have selected_names as those three, score_preset as balanced, and the rest as default.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_single_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline, single-model selection, and weighted ensemble from recommended candidates with balanced scoring\"}"
