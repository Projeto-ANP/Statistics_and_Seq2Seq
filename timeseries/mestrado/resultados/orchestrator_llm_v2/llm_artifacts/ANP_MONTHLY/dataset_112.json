      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any new ones. Also, they prefer at least three candidates. The output JSON needs to have selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, baseline_mean is a good starting point as it's a simple baseline. Then, best_per_horizon_by_validation and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 are both selection methods that might perform well. The inverse_rmse_weights and ridge_stacking are more complex methods that could add value. However, the user might want a mix of different approaches.\n\nThe score_preset can be chosen based on the focus. The balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Since the validation_summary shows that different models have varying performance across metrics, balanced might be a safe choice. Alternatively, if there's a focus on RMSE, but the user didn't specify, so sticking with balanced is probably best.\n\nParams_overrides: The user didn't mention any specific overrides, so maybe leave it as default unless needed. The example in the output_schema shows an override for topk_mean_per_horizon_k3, but in our case, the recommended candidates have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. So maybe no overrides are needed here.\n\nForce_debate and debate_margin: The user didn't mention needing a debate, so set force_debate to false and use the default margin of 0.02.\n\nRationale: Should explain the selection. Since baseline_mean is a simple approach, best_per_horizon_by_validation leverages past performance, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 averages top models, which might balance out the predictions. Also, including a weighted method like inverse_rmse_weights could add diversity.\n\nWait, the example output has selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user wants at least three. So I need to pick three from the recommended_candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended_candidates list includes baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. So selecting three of these would be appropriate.\n\nMaybe pick baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Or include the ridge stacking as well. But the user said at least three, so three is okay. Let me check the score_preset. The balanced preset is probably the safest here.\n\nSo the JSON would have selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], params_overrides as empty, score_preset as \"balanced\", force_debate false, debate_margin 0.02, and rationale explaining the selection.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for simplicity, best_per_horizon_by_validation for adaptive model selection, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 to leverage weighted ensemble with shrinkage for stability.\"}"
