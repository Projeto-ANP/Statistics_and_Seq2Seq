      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that ETS and other models have varying performance. The best_per_horizon has some models like ETS and THETA performing well in certain horizons. The recommended candidates include both baseline and more complex methods like ridge stacking.\n\nI need to select at least three candidates. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then, considering the recommended candidates, best_single_by_validation and best_per_horizon_by_validation are good options as they are selection-based and might leverage the best models. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is a weighted approach that could combine multiple models effectively. However, the user might prefer a mix of selection and weighted methods. \n\nLooking at the score_presets, \"balanced\" is a good default. The rationale should mention selecting diverse strategies. Let me check if the names are in the candidate_library. Yes, baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are all there. Maybe include ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 as another option. But the user said at least three, so maybe pick three. However, the example in the rules shows three, but the user might want more. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended_candidates list includes six, but the user might prefer a subset. \n\nI think selecting baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 would cover different approaches. Alternatively, including the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. But the user might want a balance between selection and weighting. Also, considering the score_preset, \"balanced\" is appropriate. The rationale should explain the selection based on diversity and performance.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_single_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, best_single for adaptive model selection, and inverse_rmse_weights for robust ensemble weighting.\"}"
