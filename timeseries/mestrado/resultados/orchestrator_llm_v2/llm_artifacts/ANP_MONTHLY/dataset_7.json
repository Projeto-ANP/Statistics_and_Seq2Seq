      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the recommended candidates from the tool. The recommended_candidates section lists several options, including baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not to invent any. Also, they prefer at least three candidates. The output JSON needs to have selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the first three are baseline_mean, robust_median, and robust_trimmed_mean_0.20. These are all baseline methods. Then there are selection methods like best_single_by_validation and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The weighted and stacking methods are also there. \n\nSince the validation_summary shows that there's high disagreement among models (relative_spread_mean is 0.38), maybe using a method that combines multiple models would be better. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are good candidates because they average top models or use weights based on RMSE. Ridge stacking could also be useful for combining models with regularization.\n\nI should pick a mix of baseline, selection, and weighted methods. Let's go with baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. These cover different approaches: simple averaging, selecting top models, and weighting based on performance. \n\nFor the score_preset, the balanced preset is a good default as it considers multiple metrics. The rationale should explain the selection, mentioning the high disagreement and the chosen methods' robustness. I don't need to force debate unless there's a close call, but since the user didn't specify, I'll set force_debate to false. The debate_margin can stay at the default 0.02.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to leverage top-performing models, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for adaptive weighting.
