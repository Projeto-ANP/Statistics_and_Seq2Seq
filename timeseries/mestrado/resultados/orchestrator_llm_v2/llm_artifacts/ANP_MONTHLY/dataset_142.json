      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose a multi-step combination strategy based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models per horizon vary. The recommended candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. The score presets are balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidates from the candidate_library and choose a score_preset. They also mention preferring at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there are five options. But I need to make sure they are in the candidate_library. The candidate_library has entries for baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. All these names are present in the candidate_library.\n\nNow, the score_preset. The balanced preset is a good default, but maybe the user wants something else. However, the instructions don't specify, so sticking with balanced makes sense. The rationale should explain the selection. Since the recommended candidates include a mix of baseline, selection, and stacking methods, selecting three of them would cover different approaches. Let's pick baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. That gives a baseline, a selection method, and a stacking method, which covers different strategies. The params_overrides might not be needed here unless specified, but the example shows an override for topk_mean_per_horizon_k3. However, the user hasn't mentioned any overrides, so maybe leave params_overrides as empty. The force_debate and debate_margin can be set to default unless there's a reason to change them. The rationale would be that these candidates provide a balanced approach with different methods.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline, horizon-specific selection, and stacking methods to balance robustness and adaptability across horizons\"}"
