      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any new ones. Also, they prefer at least three candidates. The output JSON needs to have selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale.\n\nLooking at the validation_summary, the best models per horizon include ETS, NaiveMovingAverage, and others. However, the recommended_candidates have a few strategies. The score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the user didn't specify a particular focus, maybe \"balanced\" is a safe choice.\n\nI should pick three or more candidates from the recommended_candidates. Let's check the names again. The recommended_candidates are baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. So selecting three of these would be good. Maybe baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Alternatively, include the inverse_rmse one as well.\n\nWait, the user said to prefer at least three candidates. Let me check the example response. The example had selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user wants at least three. However, the user also mentioned if uncertain, return baseline_mean. But since the tool's recommended_candidates have several options, maybe pick three from there.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the top ones are baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Let's pick three: baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. That covers baseline, selection, and stacking methods.\n\nFor the score_preset, since the user didn't specify, \"balanced\" is a good default. The rationale could mention selecting a mix of baseline, selection, and stacking methods to balance performance and robustness. Also, the force_debate is false unless specified, and debate_margin is 0.02 as default.\n\nSo the JSON would have selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], score_preset as \"balanced\", and the rationale explaining the selection.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected a balanced mix of baseline aggregation, per-horizon model selection, and ridge stacking to combine robustness with adaptive weighting. These strategies cover simple averaging, best model selection, and learned ensemble methods.\"}"
