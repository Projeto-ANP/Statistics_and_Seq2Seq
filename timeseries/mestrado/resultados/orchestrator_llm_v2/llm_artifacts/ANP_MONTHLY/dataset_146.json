      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library and the validation_summary to make informed choices.\n\nLooking at the validation_summary, there are 26 models, and the best_per_horizon shows that models like ETS, DWT_svr, and others have performed well in different horizons. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. These seem like solid choices.\n\nThe user instruction says to prefer at least 3 candidates. The recommended_candidates list has six, so I can pick from those. The score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the user didn't specify a preference, maybe \"balanced\" is a safe default.\n\nI need to make sure the selected_names are from the candidate_library. The recommended_candidates are all in the library. So, selecting baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, and best_per_horizon_by_validation would cover different approaches: a simple average, selecting the best single model, and per-horizon selection. Adding topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 could add more diversity, but the user might want a minimal set. However, the example in the output_schema shows three candidates. Wait, the user said to prefer at least 3, so maybe include three.\n\nWait, the output_schema example has selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user says to prefer at least 3. However, the initial instruction says if uncertain, return baseline_mean. But given the tool output, there are several candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended_candidates include six, so selecting three from them. Maybe the top three: baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation. Then set the score_preset to balanced. Also, the rationale should explain the selection. Let me make sure the names are correct and exist in the candidate_library. Yes, they are there. So the JSON would have selected_names with those three, score_preset as balanced, and rationale explaining the choice based on performance and diversity.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_single_by_validation\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, best_single_by_validation for potential sharp performance, and best_per_horizon_by_validation to leverage horizon-specific strengths.\"}"
