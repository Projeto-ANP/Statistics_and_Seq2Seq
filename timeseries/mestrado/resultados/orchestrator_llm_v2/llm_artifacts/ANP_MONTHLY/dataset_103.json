      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library provided.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models per horizon include things like DWT_svr, ARIMA, FT_rf, etc. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names from the candidate_library and choose a score_preset. The output needs to be JSON with selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the top ones are baseline_mean, best_single, best_per_horizon, topk_mean_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking. Since the user prefers at least 3 candidates, I should pick a few from these. \n\nThe score_presets available are balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. The balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Considering the validation results, maybe balanced is a good choice here as it's a general approach.\n\nFor the selected_names, I can choose baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. These cover different approaches: a simple baseline, a selection method, and a stacking method. \n\nParams_overrides might not be needed unless specified, but the example in the output_schema shows an override for topk_mean_per_horizon_k3. However, since the user says not to change params.method, maybe I should leave params_overrides as empty unless necessary. \n\nThe rationale should explain the selection. Maybe something like choosing a baseline, a per-horizon selection method, and a stacking approach to balance simplicity and complexity.\n\nI need to make sure the names are from the candidate_library. Checking the recommended_candidates, yes, those names are there. Also, force_debate is false by default, and debate_margin is 0.02 as per the example.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should have selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], score_preset as \"balanced\", and the rationale explaining the choice.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, per-horizon selection for adaptability, and ridge stacking for robust combination\"}"
