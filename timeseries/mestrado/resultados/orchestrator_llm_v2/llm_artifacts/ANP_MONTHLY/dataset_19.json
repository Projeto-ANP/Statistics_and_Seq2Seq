      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library provided in the tool response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any new ones. Also, I should prefer at least three candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there are five options here. But I need to check if they are in the candidate_library. Yes, all of them are present.\n\nNow, the score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. The user didn't specify a particular preset, so maybe I should go with the default, which is balanced. But the example in the rules shows \"balanced\" as the default if uncertain. However, the tool's recommended_candidates might have some insights. The meta flags mention horizon_heterogeneous is true, which might suggest that direction_focus could be better, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the validation_summary's best_per_horizon has some models with lower RMSE, maybe rmse_focus is better. But the user hasn't specified, so sticking with balanced might be safer.\n\nThe example in the rules shows selecting baseline_mean, but the recommended_candidates include other options. However, the user might want a mix of strategies. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The top candidates are baseline_mean, best_per_horizon, topk_mean_k5, inverse_rmse_weights, and ridge_stacking. So, selecting three from these. Maybe baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example in the rules uses baseline_mean and topk_mean_per_horizon_k3. Wait, but in the tool response, the recommended_candidates have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. However, the candidate_library also has topk_mean_per_horizon_k3, etc. But the user's example might have a different setup.\n\nWait, the user's example shows \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k3\" but in the current tool response, the recommended_candidates have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. However, the candidate_library includes various top_k values. But the user's instruction says to select from the candidate_library. So, if the recommended_candidates include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, that's a valid choice.\n\nSo, the selected_names could be baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Alternatively, maybe include inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 as well. But the user wants at least three. Let me check the score_preset. The balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Since the validation_summary shows that some models have lower RMSE (like DWT_rf), but others have better SMAPE or POCID. So, using the balanced preset might be appropriate.\n\nAlso, the rationale should explain the selection. Maybe mention that baseline_mean is a simple approach, best_per_horizon leverages past performance, and ridge_stacking combines models with regularization. That makes sense. So, the final JSON would include these three names, set score_preset to balanced, and provide a rationale.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for simplicity, best_per_horizon_by_validation for adaptive model selection, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 for robust ensemble learning with regularization.\"}"
