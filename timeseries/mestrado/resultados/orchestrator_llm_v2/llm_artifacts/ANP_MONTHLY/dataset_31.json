      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's high disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of 0.41. The best models per horizon vary, so maybe a strategy that combines top performers would be good. The recommended_candidates have a mix of baseline, selection, and weighted methods. \n\nI should select at least three candidates. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then, considering the high disagreement, maybe the robust_trimmed_mean_0.20 could handle outliers. Also, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 averages the top 5 models, which might stabilize the forecast. The inverse_rmse_weights and ridge stacking are more complex but could leverage model performance. However, the user might prefer simpler strategies first. \n\nLooking at the score_presets, \"balanced\" is a good default. The rationale should mention the high disagreement and the selection of robust methods. Let me check the candidate names again to ensure they are in the library. Yes, baseline_mean, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 are all there. Adding inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 as a fourth option might be good for weighted averaging. But the user said at least three, so maybe three is okay. Wait, the example in the rules had three, but the instruction says prefer at least three. Let me go with three for simplicity. So selected_names would be baseline_mean, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The score_preset is balanced, and the rationale explains the choice based on high disagreement and robustness.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"robust_trimmed_mean_0.20\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected robust aggregation (trimmed mean) and top-k averaging to handle high model disagreement (relative spread mean=0.41) while maintaining baseline stability.\"}"
