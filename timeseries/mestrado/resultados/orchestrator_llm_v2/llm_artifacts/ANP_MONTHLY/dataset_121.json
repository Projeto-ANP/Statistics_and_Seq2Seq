      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any new ones. Also, I should prefer at least three candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there are five options here. \n\nThe score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. The user didn't specify a particular preset, so maybe I should go with the default, which is balanced. \n\nI need to make sure that the selected_names are from the candidate_library. The recommended_candidates list includes baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. These are all valid names. \n\nThe output JSON requires selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale. Since the user didn't specify any parameter overrides, maybe I can leave params_overrides as empty. The rationale should be a short text explaining the selection. \n\nI should check if there are any risks or constraints mentioned in the candidates. For example, some methods might be unstable with few windows, but since the tool's validation_summary shows n_windows is 3, which is a small number, but the recommended candidates seem to account for that. \n\nThe user might want a balanced approach, so selecting a mix of baseline, selection, and stacking methods. Maybe pick baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Alternatively, include the topk_mean and inverse_rmse as well. But the user said at least three, so three is acceptable. \n\nLooking at the score_preset, the balanced one gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Since the validation_summary shows that different models have varying performance across these metrics, using balanced makes sense. \n\nI should also check if the force_debate and debate_margin are needed. The user didn't mention any debate, so setting force_debate to false and debate_margin to 0.02 as default. \n\nPutting it all together, the selected_names could be baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. The score_preset is balanced. The rationale would be something like selecting a mix of baseline, selection, and stacking methods for a balanced approach.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, per-horizon selection for adaptability, and ridge stacking for robust combination.\"}"
