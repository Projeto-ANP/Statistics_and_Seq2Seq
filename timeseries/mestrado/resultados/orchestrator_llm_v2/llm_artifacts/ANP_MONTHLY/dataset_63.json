      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the recommended candidates from the tool. The recommended_candidates section lists several options, including baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not to invent any new ones. Also, they prefer at least three candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there are several good options. The baseline_mean is a safe choice as it's a simple average. Then, the best_single_by_validation and best_per_horizon_by_validation are selection methods that might perform well given the validation results. The inverse_rmse_weights and ridge_stacking are more complex methods that could handle the model disagreements mentioned in the validation_summary.\n\nThe score_preset can be chosen based on the user's focus. The tool provides presets like balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the validation shows high disagreement among models, maybe a balanced approach is better to consider multiple metrics. The rationale should explain why these candidates were selected. I need to make sure not to include any candidates not listed in the library. Also, check if there are any params_overrides needed, but the user didn't mention any specific changes, so maybe leave that as default. Finally, ensure the JSON structure is correct with selected_names, score_preset, and other parameters as specified.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for stability, best_per_horizon_by_validation to leverage horizon-specific strengths, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 for adaptive weighted combination.
