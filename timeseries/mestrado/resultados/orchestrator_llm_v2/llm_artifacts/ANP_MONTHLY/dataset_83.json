      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and return at least three. The recommended_candidates have five options, so that's good. I need to pick three or more. Let me check the descriptions. Baseline_mean is a simple average, which is a good starting point. Best_per_horizon_by_validation selects the best model for each horizon, which might be effective given the validation_summary shows different models perform best at different horizons. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 averages the top 5 models, which could balance performance. The inverse_rmse_weights and ridge stacking are more complex methods that might offer better accuracy but could be unstable with few windows. Since the validation has only 3 windows, maybe the simpler methods are safer. However, the user might want a mix. Let me check the score_presets. The balanced preset weights RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID equally. The recommended candidates include a mix of selection and weighted methods. Maybe selecting baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 as they are in the recommended list and cover different approaches. Also, considering the risks, best_per_horizon might be unstable, but it's recommended. So I'll go with those three and use the balanced score_preset. No need for force_debate unless there's a big difference, but the relative spread mean is 0.155, which isn't too high. So the final answer should include those three names, balanced preset, and a rationale.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for simplicity, best_per_horizon_by_validation for adaptive model selection, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to balance performance across top models.
