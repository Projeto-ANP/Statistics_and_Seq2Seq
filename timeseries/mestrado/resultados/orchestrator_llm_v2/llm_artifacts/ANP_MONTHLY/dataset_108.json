      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any new ones. Also, they prefer at least three candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there are five options here. But I need to make sure they are in the candidate_library. Checking the candidate_library's candidates list, yes, all these names are present.\n\nNext, choosing a score_preset. The score_presets available are balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. The default is balanced, but maybe the user wants something else. However, the user hasn't specified, so sticking with the default seems safe. The rationale should explain the selection. Since the recommended_candidates include a mix of baseline, selection, and weighted methods, selecting the top three from the recommended list makes sense.\n\nSo, selected_names could be baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. These cover different approaches: baseline, selection based on past performance, and weighted averaging with shrinkage. The score_preset is balanced, which is the default. No need for force_debate unless there's a close call, but with three distinct methods, it's probably okay. The rationale would mention selecting diverse strategies from the recommended list.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected diverse strategies from recommended candidates: baseline averaging, per-horizon model selection, and inverse-RMSE weighted combination with shrinkage.\"}"
