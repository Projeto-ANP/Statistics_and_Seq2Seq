      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library. The output JSON needs selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale. The example shows selecting at least three candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended ones are baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. So I can pick three from these.\n\nLooking at the score_presets, there's balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. The user might prefer balanced if they want a general approach. The rationale should explain the selection. Since the validation_summary shows that the best models vary per horizon, using a combination of baseline, selection, and stacking methods might be good. For example, baseline_mean as a simple average, best_per_horizon_by_validation for horizon-specific models, and ridge_stacking for combining models with regularization. That gives three candidates. Also, check if params_overrides are needed. The example had a params_overrides for topk_mean_per_horizon_k3, but in this case, the recommended candidates already have their parameters set. So maybe no overrides needed. Force_debate is false unless specified. The rationale could mention diversity in approaches and leveraging different strategies.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for stability, best_per_horizon_by_validation for horizon-specific adaptability, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 to leverage model ensembling with regularization.
