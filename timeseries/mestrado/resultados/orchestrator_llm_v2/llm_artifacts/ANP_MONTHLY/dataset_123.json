      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, so maybe a strategy that adapts per horizon would be good. The recommended candidates include both selection methods (like topk_mean) and weighted methods (inverse_rmse_weights) and stacking (ridge_stacking). \n\nThe user's instructions say to select at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, I can pick baseline_mean as a simple baseline, best_per_horizon_by_validation for adaptive selection, and maybe the ridge_stacking for a more complex approach. Alternatively, the inverse_rmse_weights could be another option. \n\nThe score_preset should be chosen based on the focus. The balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Since the user didn't specify a preference, balanced is a safe choice. \n\nI need to make sure the selected names are from the candidate_library. The recommended_candidates list includes those names. So, selecting baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Also, maybe include inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 as a fourth option. But the user said at least 3, so three is okay. \n\nCheck if there are any params_overrides needed. The output_schema example shows params_overrides for topk_mean_per_horizon_k3, but in the recommended_candidates, the topk_mean is already set to k5. Maybe no overrides are needed here. \n\nSo the final JSON would have selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], score_preset as \"balanced\", and rationale explaining the choice of diverse strategies.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected diverse strategies: baseline for stability, per-horizon selection for adaptability, and ridge stacking for robust combination.\"}"
