      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models per horizon include things like THETA, ONLY_DWT_svr, and others. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library. The output JSON needs selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale. \n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the top ones are baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. The score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. \n\nSince the user wants at least 3 candidates, I should pick three from the recommended ones. Maybe baseline_mean as a safe choice, best_per_horizon_by_validation for selection, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for weighted approach. The score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. \n\nI need to make sure not to include any candidates not in the library. Also, check if there are any params_overrides needed. The recommended_candidates have params, but the user says not to change params.method. So maybe leave params_overrides as empty unless specified. \n\nThe rationale should explain the selection. Since the best models vary per horizon, using a combination of baseline, selection, and weighted methods might cover different scenarios. \n\nSo the final JSON would have selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], score_preset as \"balanced\", and rationale explaining the choice.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, per-horizon selection for adaptability, and inverse-RMSE weighting to leverage model-specific strengths while mitigating overfitting.\"}"
