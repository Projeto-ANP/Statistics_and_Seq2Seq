      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any new ones. Also, they prefer at least three candidates. The output JSON needs to have selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, baseline_mean is a good starting point as it's a simple baseline. Then, best_per_horizon_by_validation and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 are both selection methods that might perform well. The inverse_rmse_weights and ridge_stacking are more complex methods that could be considered for better performance. However, since the user might prefer a balanced approach, maybe selecting three from the recommended list.\n\nThe score_preset can be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice unless specified otherwise. The rationale should explain why these candidates were chosen. Also, check if there are any params_overrides needed. The example in the output_schema shows params_overrides for topk_mean_per_horizon_k3, but in the recommended_candidates, there's topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Maybe the user wants to adjust the top_k parameter, but the original candidate uses k5. Unless there's a reason to change it, maybe leave it as is.\n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Then set score_preset to \"balanced\" and provide a rationale about choosing a mix of baseline and selection methods. Also, check if force_debate is needed. Since the user didn't specify, default to false and debate_margin 0.02 as per the example.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, per-horizon selection for adaptability, and top-k mean for robustness against model-specific failures.\"}"
