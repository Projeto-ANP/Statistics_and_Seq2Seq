      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's high disagreement among models, with some models performing better in specific horizons. For example, NaiveSeasonal and catboost are top performers in certain periods. The recommended candidates include both baseline methods and more complex ones like ridge stacking.\n\nI need to select at least three candidates. The baseline_mean is a safe choice as it's simple and robust. Then, considering the high disagreement, maybe the robust_median or trimmed_mean would be good to include. Also, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is recommended, which averages the top 5 models, which might handle the disagreement better. The inverse_rmse_weights and ridge stacking are more advanced, but since the user might prefer a balanced approach, including one of them could be good. However, the user might want a mix of baseline and more sophisticated methods. Let me check the score_presets. The balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. \n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, robust_median, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 would cover different approaches. Alternatively, including the inverse_rmse_weights could add a weighted approach. But the user might prefer simplicity. Also, the recommended_candidates list includes topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Maybe choosing those along with baseline_mean. However, the user instruction says to prefer at least three candidates. Let me check the candidate_library again. The recommended_candidates have baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_single, best_per_horizon, topk_mean_k5, inverse_rmse, and ridge_stacking. \n\nConsidering the high disagreement, using a trimmed mean, topk mean, and a stacking method might be effective. But the user might want a balanced selection. The score_preset \"balanced\" is a good default. So, selecting baseline_mean, robust_median, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Alternatively, including the inverse_rmse_weights. But the user might not want too many. Let me go with the three that are in the recommended list and cover different strategies: baseline_mean, robust_median, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. That should be a solid selection.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"robust_median\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline methods (mean/median) for stability and a top-k averaging strategy to handle model disagreement, aligned with high-disagreement validation context.\"}"
