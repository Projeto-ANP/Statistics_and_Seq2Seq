      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any new ones. Also, prefer at least three candidates. The output JSON needs selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the first three are baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. These are all in the candidate_library. The score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. The rationale might mention selecting top candidates based on validation performance.\n\nWait, the example output in the tools had \"baseline_mean\" and \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k3\" with a params override. But in the recommended_candidates, there's topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Maybe I should pick the ones from recommended_candidates. Also, the user said to prefer at least three candidates. So maybe select baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Then set the score_preset to \"balanced\" as it's the default. The rationale could be that these candidates balance simplicity and performance, leveraging both selection and averaging strategies.\n\nI need to make sure that the selected_names are in the candidate_library. Checking the names: yes, they are all there. The params_overrides might not be needed unless specified, but the example had one. However, the user didn't mention overriding parameters, so maybe leave params_overrides as empty. The force_debate and debate_margin can be set to false and 0.02 as defaults. The rationale should explain the selection based on the validation results and strategy diversity.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected top-performing strategies balancing simplicity (baseline_mean), adaptive selection (best_per_horizon_by_validation), and ensemble robustness (topk_mean_per_horizon_k5) based on validation metrics and risk profiles.\"}"
