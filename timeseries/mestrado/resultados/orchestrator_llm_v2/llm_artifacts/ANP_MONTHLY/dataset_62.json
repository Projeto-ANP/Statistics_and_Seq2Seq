      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models per horizon include things like THETA, ONLY_DWT_catboost, and others. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library. The recommended_candidates are part of that library, so I can use those. The output needs to be JSON with selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the top ones are baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. The user wants at least 3 candidates. So maybe pick the top three from the recommended list. \n\nThe score_preset options are balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the user didn't specify, maybe default to \"balanced\" as it's the first one. \n\nParams_overrides: The example in the output_schema has a params_overrides for topk_mean_per_horizon_k3 with top_k=3. But in the recommended_candidates, there's a topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Maybe if I select that, I don't need to override unless there's a specific parameter change. But the user says not to change params.method, so maybe just use the default parameters from the candidates.\n\nRationale should be a short text explaining the selection. Since the recommended_candidates include a mix of baseline, selection, and stacking methods, the rationale could mention choosing diverse strategies for robustness.\n\nSo, selected_names could be baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. That covers baseline, selection, and stacking approaches. The score_preset is \"balanced\" as a default. No force_debate unless there's a need, but the user didn't indicate that. Debate_margin is 0.02 as per the example.\n\nCheck if all selected names are in the candidate_library. Yes, they are in the recommended_candidates list. So the JSON should have those names, the score_preset, and the rationale.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected diverse strategies: baseline averaging, per-horizon model selection, and ridge stacking for robustness across horizons\"}"
