      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that THETA, ETS, and some other models have lower RMSE and SMAPE. But the recommended candidates are strategies that combine these models. The score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the user didn't specify a preset, maybe I should go with the balanced one as a default.\n\nI need to select at least three candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, baseline_mean is a good starting point. Then, best_per_horizon_by_validation and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 are both selection methods. Also, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 are weighted and stacking methods. Maybe pick the top three from the recommended list. But the user said to prefer at least three, so maybe include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Alternatively, include one weighted method. However, the example in the rules shows selecting baseline_mean, but the user wants at least three. Wait, the example says if uncertain, return baseline_mean, but the user instruction says to prefer returning at least three. \n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the first three are baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. These are all selection-based. Maybe add the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 as a weighted method for diversity. But the user might want a mix of strategies. However, the score_preset is balanced, which weights RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. The rationale should explain the selection. \n\nI think selecting baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 makes sense. They are different approaches: baseline, selection per horizon, and top-k averaging. Also, the score_preset is balanced. The force_debate is false unless there's a need. The debate_margin is 0.02 by default. The rationale would be that these candidates balance different strategies with good performance metrics.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline averaging, per-horizon best model selection, and top-5 mean ensemble to balance robustness, adaptability, and diversity across horizons.\"}"
