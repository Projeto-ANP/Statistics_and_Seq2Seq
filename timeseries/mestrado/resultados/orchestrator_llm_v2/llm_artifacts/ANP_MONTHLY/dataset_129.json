      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose a multi-step combination strategy based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models vary per horizon. The recommended candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. The score presets are balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names from the candidate_library and choose a score_preset. They also mention preferring at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there are five options. But the candidate_library has more options, like trimmed_mean variants, other topk means, and different ridge stacking parameters.\n\nI should pick candidates that are in the recommended list but also check if there are others in the library that might be better. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. The best_per_horizon_by_validation is another recommended one. Then, maybe the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 are there. However, the user wants at least three, so maybe select three from the recommended ones. \n\nWait, the output schema example shows selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user wants at least three. The tool's recommended_candidates have five, so I can pick three of them. Let me check the names again. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nSo, selecting these three: baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Then, the score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's the default. The rationale would be that these candidates provide a mix of baseline, selection, and weighted averaging strategies, covering different approaches for robustness. \n\nI need to make sure that the selected names are in the candidate_library. Checking the candidate_library's candidates list, yes, all these names are present. Also, the params_overrides are empty unless specified, but the user didn't mention any overrides. So the JSON should have selected_names with those three, score_preset as balanced, and rationale explaining the selection.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline, per-horizon selection, and top-k averaging strategies to balance robustness and adaptability across horizons\"}"
