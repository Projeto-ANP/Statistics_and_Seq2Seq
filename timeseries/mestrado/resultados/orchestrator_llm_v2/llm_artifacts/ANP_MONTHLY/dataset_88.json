      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any new ones. Also, they prefer at least three candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The first one is baseline_mean, which is a simple average. Then there's best_per_horizon_by_validation, which selects the best model for each horizon. The third is topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, averaging the top 5 models. The other two are weighted and stacking methods.\n\nI should pick a few of these. Maybe start with baseline_mean as it's a safe choice. Then include best_per_horizon_by_validation since it's recommended. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is also a good candidate. For the score_preset, the balanced one seems reasonable as it's a mix of RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. The rationale should mention selecting these based on the validation summary and recommended candidates. I need to make sure not to include any candidates not in the library. Let me confirm the names again. Yes, those three are in the list. Also, check if there's any other parameters needed. The params_overrides might not be necessary here unless specified, but the user didn't mention any. So the JSON should have selected_names with those three, score_preset as balanced, and the rationale.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for stability, best_per_horizon_by_validation for adaptive model selection, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to leverage ensemble diversity.
