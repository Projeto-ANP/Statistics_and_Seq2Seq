      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library in the tool response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's high disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of 0.288. The best models per horizon vary, so maybe using a combination approach that averages top performers or uses weighted methods could be effective. The recommended candidates include both baseline methods and more complex ones like ridge stacking.\n\nI should select at least three candidates. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 averages the top 5 models, which might handle the high disagreement. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 uses weights based on RMSE with shrinkage, which could balance the models' contributions. Ridge stacking might be another good option, but maybe the user prefers simpler methods first. Also, the score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. I need to make sure the selected names are from the candidate_library. Let me check the names again. Yes, baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are all there. That should work.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline averaging, top-k ensemble, and inverse-RMSE weighted combination to balance robustness and adaptability across high-disagreement models\"}"
