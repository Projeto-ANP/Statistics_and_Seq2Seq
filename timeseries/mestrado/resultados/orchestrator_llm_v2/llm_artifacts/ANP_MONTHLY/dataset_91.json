      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library and the validation_summary to make informed choices.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models per horizon include things like FT_svr, ETS, and others. The recommended_candidates from the tool include baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. These seem like solid options.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library. The recommended_candidates are part of that library, so I can use those. The output needs to be JSON with selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale.\n\nLooking at the score_presets, there's balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the user didn't specify a particular focus, maybe \"balanced\" is a safe default. The rationale should explain the selection. \n\nI need to pick at least three candidates. From the recommended_candidates, baseline_mean is a good baseline. Then, best_single_by_validation and best_per_horizon_by_validation are selection methods. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights and ridge_stacking could be good for weighted approaches. However, the user might prefer a mix of different types. \n\nWait, the example output in the tool's output_schema has selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user's rules say to prefer at least 3 candidates. So maybe I should pick three from the recommended_candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The list includes baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nSelecting baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 could cover different strategies: baseline, selection, and weighted. That makes sense. The score_preset would be \"balanced\" as a default. The rationale could mention choosing a mix of methods to balance performance and robustness. \n\nI should also check if there are any params_overrides needed. The example has params_overrides for topk_mean_per_horizon_k3, but in this case, maybe there are no overrides needed unless specified. The user didn't mention any, so params_overrides can be empty. \n\nForce_debate is false by default, and debate_margin is 0.02. So the final JSON would include selected_names with those three candidates, score_preset as balanced, and the rationale explaining the selection.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_single_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for stability, best_single_by_validation for potential sharp performance, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 to leverage weighted ensemble with shrinkage for robustness.\"}"
