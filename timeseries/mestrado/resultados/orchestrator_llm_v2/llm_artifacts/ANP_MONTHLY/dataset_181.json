      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any new ones. Also, they prefer at least three candidates. The output JSON needs to have selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the top ones are baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. These are all in the candidate_library. The score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. The rationale should explain why these were selected. Maybe mention that they are recommended and balance different approaches.\n\nWait, the user also mentioned if uncertain, default to baseline_mean. But here, the tool's recommended_candidates have more options. So I should pick the top ones from there. Let me check the names again. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nI need to select at least three. Let's go with baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The params_overrides might not be needed here unless specified. The score_preset is \"balanced\" as per the example. The rationale could be that these are top-recommended strategies balancing different methods. \n\nI should make sure not to include any parameters that aren't in the candidate's params. For example, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which is already in the params. So no overrides needed. The force_debate is false by default, and debate_margin is 0.02. \n\nSo the final JSON would have selected_names as those three, score_preset as balanced, and the rationale explaining the selection based on recommendations.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected top-recommended strategies: baseline mean for stability, per-horizon best model selection for adaptability, and top-k mean for robust aggregation.\"}"
