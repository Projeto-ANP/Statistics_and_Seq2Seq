      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models per horizon vary. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library. The recommended_candidates are part of the candidate_library, so that's good. The output needs to be JSON with selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the top ones are baseline_mean, best_per_horizon, topk_mean_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. The user wants at least 3 candidates. Let's pick the top three from the recommended list: baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. \n\nFor the score_preset, the tool's score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the validation has a balanced approach with multiple metrics, \"balanced\" seems appropriate. \n\nParams_overrides: The user didn't specify any, so maybe leave it as empty. Force_debate is false unless there's a need, but the tool's output doesn't indicate a need for debate. The rationale should explain the selection, maybe mentioning the diversity of methods and the balanced approach.\n\nSo the JSON would have selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], score_preset as \"balanced\", and rationale explaining the choice.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for stability, best_per_horizon_by_validation for adaptive selection, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to balance performance across horizons using top models.\"}"
