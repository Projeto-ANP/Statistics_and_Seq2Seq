      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any new ones. Also, I should prefer at least three candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there are five options here. Let me check their descriptions and parameters.\n\nBaseline_mean is a simple average of all models, which is a good starting point. Best_per_horizon_by_validation selects the best model for each horizon, which might be effective given the validation results. Topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 averages the top 5 models per horizon, which could balance performance. The inverse_rmse_weights and ridge_stacking are more complex methods that might offer better accuracy but could be unstable with few windows. Since the validation_summary mentions n_windows is 3, which is low, maybe the more complex methods have higher risks.\n\nThe score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. The user didn't specify a preset, so I should choose one. The balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Considering the validation results, maybe balanced is a safe choice.\n\nI need to make sure I don't change the params.method. The recommended_candidates have specific parameters. For example, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 uses top_k=5. The user might want a mix of different strategies. Let me pick three candidates: baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. They cover baseline, selection, and averaging approaches. Also, including inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 could add a weighted approach, but with the risk of overfitting. However, the user might prefer a more conservative selection. \n\nWait, the output_schema example has selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"] and others. But the user wants at least three. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended_candidates list includes five, so selecting three from them makes sense. Maybe baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Then set the score_preset to balanced. Also, the rationale should explain the selection. Since the validation has low n_windows, using methods that are stable is better. The best_per_horizon and topk_mean are less risky than the weighted or stacking methods. So the rationale could mention stability with few windows.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected stable baseline and horizon-specific approaches given limited windows (n=3) and heterogeneous horizon performance\"}"
