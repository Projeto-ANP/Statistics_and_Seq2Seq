      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library provided.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models per horizon vary. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. These seem like solid choices. \n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names from the candidate_library. The recommended_candidates are part of that library, so that's good. The output needs to have selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale.\n\nLooking at the score_presets, there are options like balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the user didn't specify a particular focus, maybe \"balanced\" is a safe default. \n\nThe rationale should explain the selection. The recommended_candidates include a baseline, selection methods, weighted approaches, and stacking. Choosing three or more candidates is preferred. Let me check the candidate_library again to ensure the names are correct.\n\nThe selected_names could be baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. These cover different strategies: baseline, selection, and weighted. Also, the ridge_stacking might be another good candidate, but maybe three is enough. \n\nParams_overrides might not be needed unless specified, but the example in output_schema shows an override for topk_mean_per_horizon_k3. However, the user didn't mention any overrides, so maybe leave params_overrides as empty. \n\nForce_debate is false by default unless there's a reason to set it. The debate_margin is 0.02 as per the example. The rationale could mention selecting diverse strategies from the recommended list. \n\nSo, putting it all together: selected_names as baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, score_preset as balanced, and the rationale explaining the selection.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected diverse strategies: baseline aggregation, per-horizon model selection, and inverse-RMSE weighted averaging from recommended candidates\"}"
