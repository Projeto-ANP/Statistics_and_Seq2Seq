      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models per horizon include things like \"ONLY_CWT_catboost\" and \"FT_rf\". The recommended candidates from the tool include baseline methods like mean and median, as well as more complex ones like inverse RMSE weights and ridge stacking. \n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library. The recommended_candidates section lists several options: baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nI need to pick at least three candidates. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then, considering the high disagreement mentioned in the meta flags, maybe the robust_median and robust_trimmed_mean_0.20 would be good as they are robust to outliers. Also, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is recommended, which averages the top 5 models. \n\nFor the score_preset, the balanced option is probably a good default. The rationale should mention selecting robust methods and averaging top models to handle high disagreement. I should make sure not to include any candidates not in the library and follow the parameter overrides if needed. Let me check the parameters again to ensure they're correct. Yep, the selected names are all in the candidate_library. Alright, that should work.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"robust_median\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected robust baseline methods and top-k averaging to handle high model disagreement while maintaining stability\"}"
