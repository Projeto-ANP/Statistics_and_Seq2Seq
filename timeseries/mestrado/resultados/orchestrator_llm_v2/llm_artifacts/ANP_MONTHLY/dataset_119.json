      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library in the tool response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's high disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of 0.335. The best models per horizon vary, so maybe using a combination approach that averages top performers or uses weights based on past performance could be good. \n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the baseline_mean is a simple average, which is straightforward but might be sensitive to outliers. The robust_median and trimmed_mean are more robust. The best_per_horizon_by_validation selects the best model for each horizon, which could be effective if the best models are consistent. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 averages the top 5 models, which might balance performance and stability. The inverse_rmse_weights and ridge_stacking are more complex, using weights or stacking to combine models.\n\nSince the user prefers at least 3 candidates, I should pick a mix of baseline, selection, and weighted methods. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is recommended and might handle the high disagreement well. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 uses shrinkage to avoid overfitting, which could be good here. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 might provide another layer of combination. However, the user might want a few different approaches. \n\nWait, the output_schema example has selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user wants at least 3. So I need to select three from the recommended_candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The top ones are baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nConsidering the high disagreement, maybe the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights, and ridge_stacking would be good. But the user might prefer a mix of baseline and more advanced methods. Alternatively, the best_per_horizon_by_validation could be paired with others. \n\nThe score_preset is set to \"balanced\" by default, but the user might want to adjust based on the focus. However, the instructions say to choose a score_preset, so I'll go with \"balanced\" unless there's a reason to change. \n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. These cover different approaches: simple average, top-k averaging, and weighted inverse RMSE. That should provide a good mix. Also, including ridge_stacking might be another option, but maybe three is enough. Let me confirm the names are in the candidate_library. Yes, all these names are present. \n\nThe rationale should explain the selection. Since there's high disagreement, using a combination of top models and weighted approaches makes sense. The baseline is included as a conservative choice.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for stability, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to leverage top-performing models, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 to dynamically weight models by historical accuracy. High disagreement justifies diverse approaches.\"}"
