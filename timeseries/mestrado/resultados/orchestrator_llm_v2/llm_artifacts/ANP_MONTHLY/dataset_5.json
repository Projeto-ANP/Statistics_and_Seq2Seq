      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's high disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of 3.69. The best models per horizon include things like ONLY_FT_svr, ONLY_CWT_catboost, ETS, etc. Since there's high disagreement, maybe using a method that combines multiple models would be better than relying on a single one. \n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 averages the top 5 models per horizon, which could help mitigate the disagreement. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 uses weights based on RMSE with shrinkage, which might balance the models' contributions. Ridge stacking could also be effective, but with only 3 windows, it might be unstable. \n\nThe score_presets have options like balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the user didn't specify a preference, maybe \"balanced\" is a safe choice. \n\nI should select at least three candidates. Let's go with topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. These cover different approaches: averaging top models, weighted by RMSE, and stacking. Also, including baseline_mean as a conservative option. Wait, the user said to prefer at least three, but the example had three. However, the initial output schema had baseline_mean. Maybe include the top three from the recommended_candidates. \n\nWait, the recommended_candidates list includes baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. So selecting three from these. Maybe topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 as they are more advanced methods. But the user might want a mix. Alternatively, include baseline_mean for stability. \n\nBut the user instruction says to prefer returning at least 3 candidates. Let me check the example again. The example had selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user says to prefer at least 3. However, if uncertain, return baseline_mean. But in this case, since the tool has recommended_candidates, maybe pick three from there. \n\nLooking at the validation_summary, the best_per_horizon_by_validation is a candidate. But the recommended_candidates include that. So maybe select topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Also, the score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a general choice. \n\nI need to make sure the names are from the candidate_library. Yes, those names are present. So the final selection would be those three, with score_preset as balanced. Also, the rationale should explain the choice based on high disagreement and the need for robust methods.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected top-performing combination strategies to address high model disagreement: top-k averaging (k=5) for robustness, inverse-RMSE weighting with shrinkage for adaptive model emphasis, and ridge stacking for structured ensemble learning.\"}"
