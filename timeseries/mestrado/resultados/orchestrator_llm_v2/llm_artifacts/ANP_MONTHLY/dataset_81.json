      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any new ones. Also, they prefer at least three candidates. The output JSON needs to have selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, baseline_mean is a good starting point as it's a simple baseline. Then, best_per_horizon_by_validation and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 are both selection methods that might perform well. The inverse_rmse_weights and ridge_stacking are more complex methods that could add value. However, the user might want a mix of different approaches.\n\nThe score_preset can be set to \"balanced\" as it's a common choice unless specified otherwise. The rationale should explain why these candidates were chosen. Since the validation_summary shows that there's some disagreement among models, maybe including both selection and weighted methods would be beneficial.\n\nI need to make sure that the selected_names are present in the candidate_library. Checking the names: baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 are all in the library. But the user asked for at least three, so maybe pick three that cover different strategies. Baseline, selection, and stacking. Or include the inverse_rmse as a weighted approach.\n\nWait, the example output in the tool's output_schema has selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user wants at least three. However, the user also says if uncertain, return the baseline. But since the tool's recommended_candidates have five, maybe pick three from there. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended_candidates list includes baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. So selecting three of these would be appropriate.\n\nI think selecting baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 would cover different approaches: a simple average, selection-based, and a stacking method. That provides a good mix. The score_preset can be \"balanced\" as it's a safe choice. The rationale would mention the diversity of methods and the balanced approach.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, per-horizon selection for adaptability, and ridge stacking for robust combination.
