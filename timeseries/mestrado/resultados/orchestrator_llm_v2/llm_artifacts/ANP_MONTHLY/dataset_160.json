      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's some disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of about 0.25. The best models vary per horizon, so maybe a strategy that adapts per horizon would be good. The recommended candidates include both selection methods (like topk_mean) and weighted methods (inverse_rmse_weights) as well as stacking.\n\nI should select at least three candidates. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then, the best_per_horizon_by_validation could be good for adapting to each horizon. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 might perform well by weighting models based on their RMSE. The ridge_stacking is another option, but maybe the user prefers simpler methods first. Let me check the score_presets. The balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Since the user didn't specify a preset, maybe \"balanced\" is a good default. \n\nI need to make sure the selected names are from the candidate_library. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is there, as well as the inverse_rmse_weights. So, selecting baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. That's three candidates. The rationale would be that they balance simplicity, horizon-specific selection, and weighted averaging based on performance.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Balances simplicity (baseline_mean), horizon-specific adaptability (best_per_horizon), and performance-weighted aggregation (inverse_rmse_weights) to handle heterogeneous model behavior\"}"
