      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's high disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of 0.568. The best models vary per horizon, so maybe using a method that adapts per horizon would be good. The recommended candidates include per-horizon strategies like best_per_horizon_by_validation and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is a weighted approach that might handle the varying performance.\n\nI should select candidates that address both the high disagreement and the need for per-horizon adaptation. The baseline_mean is a safe choice, but maybe adding the robust_median and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 would provide more robustness. The inverse_rmse_weights and ridge stacking could be good for combining models with weights. However, the user said to prefer at least 3 candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended ones include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_single, best_per_horizon, topk_mean_k5, inverse_rmse, and ridge_stacking. \n\nSince the score_preset isn't specified, maybe \"balanced\" is a good default. The rationale should mention handling high disagreement and leveraging per-horizon strategies. I need to make sure the selected names are in the candidate_library. Let me pick baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Alternatively, maybe include the inverse_rmse_weights as well. Wait, the user said at least 3, so maybe three. Let me check the example output. The example had baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k3, and score_preset balanced. But in this case, the recommended_candidates have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. So perhaps selecting baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Also, considering the high disagreement, the robust_median might be useful. But the example output had baseline_mean as the only selected. However, the user instruction says to prefer at least 3. Let me go with baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. The score_preset could be balanced. The rationale would be that these strategies handle high disagreement and adapt per horizon.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected strategies address high model disagreement (relative spread 0.57) while leveraging per-horizon adaptation (best_per_horizon) and robust combination (ridge stacking) to stabilize forecasts across varying horizons.\"}"
