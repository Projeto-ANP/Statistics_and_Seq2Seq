      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library in the tool response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and return at least three candidates. The output JSON needs selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the top ones are baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, and best_per_horizon_by_validation. Also, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are there. The ridge_stacking is another option. \n\nThe score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the validation_summary shows that some models have lower RMSE, maybe balanced is a good preset. \n\nI should pick three candidates. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then, best_single_by_validation and best_per_horizon_by_validation are both selection methods. Alternatively, maybe include a weighted method like inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for diversity. But the user said to prefer at least three, so maybe baseline_mean, best_single, and inverse_rmse. \n\nWait, the recommended_candidates list includes baseline_mean, best_single, best_per_horizon, topk_mean_k5, inverse_rmse, and ridge_stacking. So selecting three from these. Let me check the rationale. The tool's recommended_candidates have a meta with flags like strong_single: true, so maybe best_single is good. Also, the topk_mean and inverse_rmse could be good for combining models. \n\nI think selecting baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 would be a good mix. The score_preset could be balanced as it's a general choice. The rationale would be that these strategies balance simplicity, single-model performance, and weighted combination based on RMSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_single_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Balanced approach combining baseline robustness, single-model validation selection, and inverse-RMSE weighted aggregation for horizon-specific optimization\"}"
