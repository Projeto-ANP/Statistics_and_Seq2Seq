      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's high disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of 0.2789 and a p90 of 0.3987. Also, there are some strong single models. The score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. \n\nSince the models disagree a lot, maybe a strategy that combines multiple models would be better than relying on a single one. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 averages the top 5 models, which could help reduce variance. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 uses weights based on RMSE, which might give more importance to better models. Ridge stacking could also be good for combining models with some regularization.\n\nI should select candidates that are recommended and fit the scenario. The user mentioned preferring at least 3 candidates. Let's pick baseline_mean for simplicity, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for combining top models, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for weighted averaging. Also, maybe include ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 as another option. \n\nFor the score_preset, balanced seems reasonable since it's a mix of RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. The rationale should explain that these strategies handle disagreement and leverage top models. I need to make sure the selected names are in the candidate_library. Let me check again: yes, all these names are present. Alright, that should work.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected strategies balance robustness (baseline_mean), ensemble diversity (topk_mean_per_horizon_k5), adaptive weighting (inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35), and regularization-based stacking (ridge_stacking_l250_topk5) to address high model disagreement and heterogeneous horizon performance.\"}"
