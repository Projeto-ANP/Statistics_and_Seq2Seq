      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the recommended candidates from the tool. The recommended_candidates section lists several options, including baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not to invent any new ones. Also, they prefer at least three candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there are several good options. The baseline_mean is a safe choice as a starting point. Then, the best_per_horizon_by_validation might be useful since the validation_summary mentions that there are unique winners for each horizon. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is also a strong candidate because stacking methods can combine models effectively, and the tool's meta flags indicate high disagreement among models, so stacking might help.\n\nI should check the score_presets. The balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Since the user didn't specify a particular focus, balanced might be a good default. Also, the tool's recommended_candidates include a mix of baseline, selection, and stacking methods, which covers different approaches.\n\nI need to make sure that the selected names are in the candidate_library. The names listed in recommended_candidates are all present in the candidate_library. So, selecting baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 makes sense. These three cover different strategies: a simple average, horizon-specific selection, and a stacking method. \n\nThe params_overrides should be empty unless specified, but the user didn't mention any overrides, so leave it as default. The score_preset is set to balanced. Force_debate is false unless there's a need for it, but with three candidates, it's probably not necessary. The rationale should explain the selection, mentioning the diversity of methods and the balanced approach.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected diverse strategies: baseline_mean (simple robust average), best_per_horizon_by_validation (adaptive selection for heterogeneous horizons), and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 (regularized ensemble to handle high model disagreement).
