      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library provided in the tool response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any new ones. Also, I should prefer returning at least three candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The first one is baseline_mean, which is a simple average. Then there's best_per_horizon_by_validation, which selects the best model for each horizon. The third is topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, averaging the top 5 models. The fourth is inverse_rmse_weights with shrinkage, and the fifth is ridge stacking.\n\nI need to pick at least three. Maybe start with baseline_mean as a conservative choice. Then include best_per_horizon_by_validation since it's recommended. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is also a good candidate. Alternatively, the inverse_rmse_weights might be better for weighted averaging. But the user might want a mix of different approaches. Let me check the score_presets. The balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. \n\nLooking at the validation_summary, the best models per horizon vary, so using a combination of selection and weighting methods could be effective. Maybe include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Or perhaps the ridge stacking as well. But the user said at least three. Let me make sure the names are in the candidate_library. Yes, all the recommended ones are there. \n\nI should also choose a score_preset. The balanced one is a safe choice unless there's a reason to focus on a specific metric. Since the user didn't specify, balanced makes sense. The rationale should explain the selection, maybe mentioning diversity in approaches. Alright, I think that's a solid selection.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for stability, best_per_horizon_by_validation for adaptive selection, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for robust weighted aggregation.
