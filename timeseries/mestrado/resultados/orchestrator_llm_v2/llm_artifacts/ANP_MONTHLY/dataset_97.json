      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that models like THETA and ETS have lower RMSE and SMAPE values, which are good. But the user is asking for combination strategies, not individual models. So I should focus on the candidates that combine multiple models.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, baseline_mean is a simple average, which is a good starting point. Then there's best_per_horizon_by_validation, which selects the best model for each horizon. That might be effective since the best models vary by horizon. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 averages the top 5 models per horizon, which could balance performance. The inverse_rmse_weights and ridge_stacking are more complex methods that assign weights based on past performance.\n\nThe score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the user didn't specify a preference, maybe \"balanced\" is a safe choice. But I should check which strategies align with the presets. For example, if the user cares more about RMSE, then rmse_focus would be better, but without knowing, balanced is a default.\n\nI need to select at least three candidates. From the recommended_candidates, baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 are all there. Also, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 are other options. But the user might prefer a mix of different approaches: a baseline, a selection method, and a weighted method.\n\nThe rationale should explain why these were chosen. Maybe mention that baseline_mean is a simple approach, best_per_horizon_by_validation adapts to each horizon, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 averages top performers for robustness. Also, considering the score_preset as balanced since it's a common choice unless specified otherwise.\n\nI need to make sure the selected_names are from the candidate_library. The names in the recommended_candidates are all present in the candidate_library. So selecting those three should be okay. Also, check if there's any override parameters, but the user didn't mention any, so params_overrides can be empty. Force_debate is false by default unless there's a reason to debate, but with three candidates, maybe not necessary. The debate_margin is 0.02 as per the instructions if uncertain, but since we have a rationale, maybe it's okay to leave it as default.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for simplicity, best_per_horizon_by_validation for adaptive horizon-specific selection, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to balance performance across top models.
