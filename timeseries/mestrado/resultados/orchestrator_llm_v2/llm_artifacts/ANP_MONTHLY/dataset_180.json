      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that the best models per horizon vary, with catboost and NaiveMovingAverage appearing frequently. The disagreement metrics indicate some spread in model performance, but not extremely high. The score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. \n\nSince the user prefers at least three candidates, I should select from the recommended ones. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. The best_per_horizon_by_validation is another good candidate as it selects the best model per horizon. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 averages the top 5 models, which might balance performance. The inverse_rmse_weights and ridge_stacking are more complex but could offer better results. However, considering the number of windows is only 3, maybe the simpler methods are more stable. \n\nI should check the score_preset. The balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Since the user didn't specify a preset, defaulting to balanced makes sense. Also, the rationale should explain the selection. Maybe pick baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 as they are recommended and cover different approaches. The inverse_rmse and ridge_stacking might be too complex with limited data. So, the final selection would be those three with the balanced preset.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for stability, best_per_horizon_by_validation for adaptive selection, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to leverage ensemble diversity.
