      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library provided in the tool response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any new ones. Also, I should prefer at least three candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there are five options here. Let me check their descriptions.\n\nBaseline_mean is a simple average of all models, which is a good starting point. Best_per_horizon_by_validation selects the best model for each horizon, which might be effective given the validation results. Topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 averages the top 5 models per horizon, which could balance performance. The inverse_rmse_weights and ridge_stacking are more complex methods that might offer better accuracy but could be unstable with few windows. Since the validation has only 3 windows, maybe the simpler methods are safer.\n\nThe score_preset options are balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. The user didn't specify a preference, so maybe \"balanced\" is a safe choice. Also, the tool's recommended_candidates include a mix of baseline, selection, and stacking methods. I should pick three from these. Let's go with baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. They cover different approaches and are recommended. The rationale could mention selecting diverse methods that are stable with limited data.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected diverse approaches: baseline averaging, per-horizon best model selection, and top-k mean aggregation.
