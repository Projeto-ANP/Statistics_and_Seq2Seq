      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's high disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of 0.7675 and a p90 of 1.164. This suggests that models vary a lot in their performance, so maybe using a combination that averages or weights them could be better. The best models per horizon include NaiveMovingAverage, ARIMA, FT_rf, etc., but they aren't consistent across all horizons.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the baseline methods like mean and median are there, which are simple but might not capture the best performers. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are more sophisticated, using top models and weighting by RMSE. Ridge stacking is another option, which might handle the high disagreement better by combining models with regularization.\n\nSince the user prefers at least three candidates, I should pick a mix. Maybe start with the baseline_mean as a safe choice. Then include the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, which averages the top 5 models per horizon, which could handle the high disagreement. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 uses weights based on RMSE with shrinkage, which might balance the models' contributions. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 could be another good candidate as it uses a stacking approach with regularization.\n\nWait, the output_schema example has selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user wants at least three. So I need to select three or more. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended ones include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nConsidering the high disagreement, maybe the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 would be good. They all aim to combine models in different ways. Also, including the baseline_mean as a conservative option. But the user said to prefer at least three. Let me pick three from the recommended ones. Maybe baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Alternatively, include the ridge stacking as well. But the example in the output_schema has only one, but the user instruction says to prefer at least three. So I need to select three.\n\nLooking at the score_presets, \"balanced\" is a preset that weights RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Since the user didn't specify a preset, maybe default to \"balanced\". The rationale should explain the selection based on high disagreement and the need for robust methods. So the selected_names would be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example only has one, but the user says to return at least three. Let me confirm the candidate names from the library. Yes, those are all in the candidate_library. So the final selection would be those three or four, with the balanced score_preset.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected diverse strategies to handle high model disagreement: baseline_mean (simple robust average), topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 (averages top-performing models), inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 (weights models by RMSE with shrinkage), and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 (regularized stacking for stability).
