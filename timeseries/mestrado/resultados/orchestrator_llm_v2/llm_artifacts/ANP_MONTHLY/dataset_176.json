      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's high disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of 0.557. The best models vary per horizon, so maybe using a method that adapts per horizon would be good. The recommended candidates include per-horizon strategies like best_per_horizon_by_validation and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 uses weights based on RMSE with shrinkage, which might handle the high disagreement.\n\nI should select candidates that address the high disagreement and leverage the per-horizon best models. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 averages the top 5 models, which could smooth out some of the discrepancies. The ridge stacking might be effective as it uses a rolling training approach. Also, including the baseline_mean as a simple average could serve as a benchmark. The robust_median and trimmed mean are also good for robustness against outliers.\n\nThe score_preset should be \"balanced\" since the user didn't specify a preference, and the default is balanced. I need to make sure the selected names are from the candidate_library. Let me check the names again. Yes, all the selected ones are there. The rationale should mention the high disagreement and the selection of strategies to handle it.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected strategies address high model disagreement (relative spread mean 0.557) with per-horizon adaptation (best_per_horizon_by_validation), robust weighting (inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35), and ensemble learning (ridge_stacking_l250_topk5), while maintaining a baseline for comparison.\"}"
