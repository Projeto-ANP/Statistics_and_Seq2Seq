      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library provided.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models per horizon include things like ETS, DWT_svr, FT_catboost, etc. The recommended candidates from the tool include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library. The output JSON needs selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale. \n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the top ones are baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. The score presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. \n\nSince the user wants at least 3 candidates, I should pick three from the recommended ones. Maybe baseline_mean as a conservative choice, best_per_horizon_by_validation for selection, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for weighted approach. Alternatively, the ridge stacking could be another option. \n\nThe score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. The rationale should explain why these were selected. Also, check if there are any params_overrides needed. The tool's recommended_candidates have parameters set, so maybe no overrides unless specified. \n\nWait, the output_schema example shows params_overrides with topk_mean_per_horizon_k3, but in the recommended_candidates, there's topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Maybe the user wants to adjust the top_k? But the instructions say not to change params.method. So maybe just use the parameters as they are. \n\nSo, selected_names could be baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Or include the ridge stacking as well. But the example output has three candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended_candidates list includes five, but the user wants at least three. \n\nI think selecting baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 makes sense. The score_preset is balanced. The rationale could mention combining baseline, selection, and weighted methods for robustness. Also, since the tool's meta flags have horizon_heterogeneous as true, maybe the best_per_horizon is good. \n\nI need to make sure the names are exactly as in the candidate_library. The candidate_library has \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\". Yes. So the selected_names would be those three. The params_overrides might be empty unless there's a need to adjust, but the user says not to change params.method. So params_overrides is empty. \n\nTherefore, the JSON should have selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], score_preset as \"balanced\", and rationale explaining the selection.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, per-horizon selection for adaptability, and inverse-RMSE weighting to leverage model-specific strengths while mitigating overfitting.\"}"
