      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's high disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of 0.428. This suggests that models vary a lot in their performance, so maybe using a combination method that can handle this variability would be good. The best_per_horizon_by_validation and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 are selection methods that might help by picking the best models for each horizon or averaging the top ones. The inverse_rmse_weights and ridge stacking are weighted methods that could adaptively combine models based on their past performance.\n\nSince the user prefers at least three candidates, I should select a mix of baseline, selection, and weighted methods. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. The best_per_horizon_by_validation is recommended as it selects the best model per horizon, which is useful given the high disagreement. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 averages the top 5 models, which might smooth out some of the variability. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is a weighted approach that could give more weight to better-performing models. Ridge stacking might be another good option, but maybe the user wants a balance between different types of strategies.\n\nWait, the output needs to have selected_names from the candidate_library. Let me check the names again. The recommended_candidates include \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", and \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\". So I can pick these along with baseline_mean and robust_median. But the user said to prefer at least three candidates. Maybe select baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Alternatively, include the topk_mean as well. Let me check the score_presets. The balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Since the validation has high disagreement, maybe a strategy that combines multiple models (like topk_mean) would be better. Also, the ridge stacking might be more complex but could handle the heterogeneity. However, with only 3 windows, some methods might be unstable. The user might prefer a mix of selection and weighted methods. So, selecting baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Or maybe include the topk_mean as well. Let me go with three: baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. The score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a general approach. The rationale would be that these strategies balance robustness, selection of top models, and adaptive weighting based on past performance.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline robustness, per-horizon selection for high disagreement, and adaptive inverse-RMSE weighting to balance model performance\"}"
