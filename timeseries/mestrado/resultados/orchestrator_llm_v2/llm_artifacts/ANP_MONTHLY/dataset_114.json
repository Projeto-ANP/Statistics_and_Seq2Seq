      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any new ones. Also, I should prefer at least three candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there are five options. Let me check their descriptions and parameters.\n\nBaseline_mean is a simple average of all models, which is a good starting point. Best_per_horizon_by_validation selects the best model for each horizon, which might be effective given the validation results. Topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 averages the top 5 models per horizon, which could balance performance. The inverse_rmse_weights and ridge_stacking are more complex methods that might offer better accuracy but could be unstable with few windows. Since the validation_summary mentions n_windows is 3, which is low, maybe the more complex methods have higher risks.\n\nThe score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. The user didn't specify a preset, so I should choose one. The balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Considering the validation results, SMAPE and MAPE are lower for some models, but RMSE is a key metric here. However, since the user didn't specify, maybe \"balanced\" is a safe default.\n\nI need to select at least three candidates. Let's pick baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. These are all in the recommended_candidates and have different approaches. Also, the rationale should explain the selection. Maybe mention that these strategies balance simplicity and performance, leveraging both individual model strengths and ensemble methods.\n\nCheck if there are any params_overrides needed. The output_schema example shows params_overrides for topk_mean_per_horizon_k3, but in our case, the selected candidates don't have parameters that need overriding. So params_overrides can be empty. Force_debate is false by default unless specified, and debate_margin is 0.02 as per instructions.\n\nSo the final JSON should include selected_names with those three candidates, score_preset as balanced, and the rationale explaining the choice.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for simplicity, best_per_horizon_by_validation for adaptive model selection, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to balance performance across top models. Balanced preset weights multiple metrics evenly.\"}"
