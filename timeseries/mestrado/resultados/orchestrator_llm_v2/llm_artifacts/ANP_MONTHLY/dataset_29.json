      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library in the tool response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's high disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of 0.368. The best models per horizon are things like ONLY_CWT_svr, THETA, ARIMA, etc. Since there's high disagreement, maybe using a method that combines multiple models would be better than selecting a single one. \n\nLooking at the recommended candidates, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 averages the top 5 models per horizon, which could help mitigate the disagreement. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 uses weights based on RMSE with shrinkage, which might balance the models' contributions. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is a stacking method that could capture more complex relationships.\n\nFor the score_preset, the balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Since the user didn't specify a preference, balanced is a safe choice. I should select at least three candidates. Let's go with topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. These cover different approaches: averaging top models, weighted by RMSE, and stacking. That should provide a good mix of strategies.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected top-k averaging, inverse-RMSE weighting, and ridge stacking to handle high model disagreement while balancing accuracy and directionality\"}"
