      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models with varying RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID scores. The best models per horizon include ARIMA, DWT_rf, NaiveSeasonal, etc. The disagreement metrics have a relative spread mean of around 0.045, which isn't too high, but there's some variation.\n\nSince the user prefers at least 3 candidates, I should pick a few from the recommended ones. The baseline_mean is a safe choice as a starting point. Then, considering the best_single_by_validation and best_per_horizon_by_validation could be good selections since they leverage past performance. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 might offer better performance by combining models with regularization.\n\nFor the score_preset, the balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, and others. Since the user didn't specify a preference, balanced is a reasonable default. I should check if the selected candidates are in the candidate_library. Yes, all the names are there. No need to override parameters unless specified, so params_overrides can be empty. Force_debate is false unless there's a close call, but with the given data, it's probably not needed. The rationale should explain the selection based on the validation results and strategy types.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_single_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for stability, best_single_by_validation to leverage top-performing models, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 for robust ensemble learning.
