      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library provided.\n\nThe validation summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models per horizon include things like FT_catboost, THETA, and others. The recommended candidates from the tool include baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not to invent any. Also, prefer at least 3 candidates. The score_preset can be one of the provided ones like balanced, rmse_focus, etc.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the top ones are baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean_0.20, best_single, best_per_horizon, topk_mean_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nI should pick a few of these. Maybe start with the baseline_mean as it's a simple average. Then, the best_single_by_validation could be good for selecting the top model each time. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights might be useful for weighting models based on their performance. Ridge stacking could add another layer of complexity. \n\nWait, the user said to return at least 3 candidates. Let me check the candidate_library again. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean_0.20, best_single, best_per_horizon, topk_mean_k5, inverse_rmse_weights, and ridge_stacking. \n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, maybe include the ridge_stacking. But the user might want a mix of different types. The score_preset could be balanced as it's a common choice. \n\nI need to make sure the names are exactly as in the candidate_library. The tool's recommended_candidates have \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" and \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\". So those are valid. \n\nSo the selected_names would be baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. That's four candidates. The score_preset is balanced. No need for force_debate unless specified. The rationale could mention choosing a mix of baseline, selection, weighted, and stacking methods to cover different strategies.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_single_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected diverse strategies: baseline averaging, single-model selection, inverse-RMSE weighting, and ridge stacking to balance robustness, adaptability, and model fusion.\"}"
