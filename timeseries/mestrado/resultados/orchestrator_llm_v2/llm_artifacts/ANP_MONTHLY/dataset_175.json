      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any new ones. Also, they prefer at least three candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there are five options. I should pick at least three of these. \n\nThe score_preset options are balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. The user didn't specify a particular preset, so maybe \"balanced\" is a safe default. \n\nThe rationale needs to be a short text explaining the selection. Since the recommended candidates include a baseline, a selection method, a weighted method, and a stacking method, combining these could provide a balanced approach. \n\nI should check if there are any parameters to override. The output_schema example shows params_overrides, but the user didn't mention any specific changes, so maybe leave that as empty unless necessary. \n\nAlso, the force_debate and debate_margin are optional. Since the user didn't specify needing a debate, set force_debate to false and use the default margin. \n\nSo, selecting three candidates: baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. These cover different approaches: baseline, selection, and stacking. The score_preset is balanced. The rationale would be something like \"Selected a baseline, per-horizon best model selection, and ridge stacking for a balanced approach considering different strategies.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, per-horizon selection for adaptability, and ridge stacking for robust combination\"}"
