      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models per horizon include things like ONLY_CWT_rf, FT_svr, CWT_rf, etc. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library. The output JSON needs selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale. \n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the top ones are baseline_mean, best_single, best_per_horizon, topk_mean_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking. Since the user prefers at least 3 candidates, I should pick three from these. \n\nThe score_preset options are balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, robust_smape. The validation_summary's best models have low RMSE, SMAPE, etc. Maybe \"balanced\" is a good preset here. \n\nParams_overrides: The user might want to adjust parameters, but the instructions say not to change params.method. So if I select a candidate that has parameters, I can't change the method, but maybe adjust other parameters if allowed. However, the example in output_schema shows params_overrides for topk_mean_per_horizon_k3 with top_k=3. But in the recommended_candidates, there's topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Maybe the user wants to adjust top_k? But the original candidate has top_k=5. However, the user says not to change params.method, but maybe other parameters are okay. However, the example in the output_schema shows overriding top_k for a different candidate. But in the current case, the recommended_candidates have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, which already has top_k=5. So maybe no need to override unless specified. \n\nWait, the user says \"Do NOT change params.method.\" So if a candidate's params have a method, we can't change that. But other parameters like top_k or shrinkage can be adjusted? The example in the output_schema shows overriding top_k for a candidate that has top_k=3. But in the current case, the candidate_library has topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=5. So maybe the user wants to select that as is. \n\nSo, for selected_names, I can pick baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. These are all in the recommended_candidates. The rationale would be that these strategies balance simplicity, model selection, and weighted averaging based on validation performance. \n\nScore_preset: \"balanced\" seems appropriate as it's the default and covers multiple metrics. \n\nForce_debate: False unless there's a need, but the user didn't specify any debate. \n\nDebate_margin: 0.02 as default. \n\nSo the JSON would have selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_single_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], score_preset \"balanced\", and other defaults.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_single_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline averaging, single-model selection, and weighted ensemble to balance robustness and adaptability across horizons\"}"
