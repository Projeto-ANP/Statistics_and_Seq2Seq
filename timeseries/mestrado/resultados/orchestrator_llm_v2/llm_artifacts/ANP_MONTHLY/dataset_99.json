      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and prefer at least three candidates. The score_preset can be one of the provided options like \"balanced\", \"rmse_focus\", etc. \n\nLooking at the validation_summary, the models have varying RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID scores. The best_per_horizon_by_validation is recommended, which selects the best model for each horizon. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 averages the top 5 models per horizon, which might balance performance. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 uses weights based on RMSE with some shrinkage, which could handle model variability. Ridge stacking with l2=50 and topk=5 is another option that combines models using a ridge regression approach.\n\nI should pick three or more candidates. Let's go with baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. These are all in the recommended_candidates. For the score_preset, \"balanced\" seems appropriate as it equally weights RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. No need for force_debate unless there's a close call, but the rationale here is to select stable methods. So the JSON should include these names, the balanced preset, and the rationale.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline aggregation, per-horizon best model selection, and top-5 ensemble to balance stability and adaptability across horizons\"}"
