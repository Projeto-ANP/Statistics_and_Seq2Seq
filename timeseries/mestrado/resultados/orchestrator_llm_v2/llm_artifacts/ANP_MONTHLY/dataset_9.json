      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models per horizon vary. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library. The recommended_candidates are part of the candidate_library, so that's good. The output needs to have selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the top ones are baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. The user wants at least 3 candidates. \n\nThe score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the validation has a balanced approach with RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID, maybe \"balanced\" is a good preset.\n\nI should select three candidates. Let's pick baseline_mean as a safe choice, best_per_horizon_by_validation for selection, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 as a weighted method. Alternatively, ridge_stacking could be another option. But the user might prefer a mix of baseline, selection, and weighted methods.\n\nWait, the example in the rules shows selecting baseline_mean, but the user wants at least three. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. So selecting three from these would be appropriate.\n\nSo, selected_names could be [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"]. The score_preset would be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. The rationale could mention the balance between different metrics and the use of both selection and weighting methods.\n\nI need to make sure that the params_overrides are correct. The example in the output_schema has params_overrides for topk_mean_per_horizon_k3, but in our case, the selected candidates don't have parameters that need overriding. So params_overrides can be empty.\n\nForce_debate is false by default unless specified. Debate_margin is 0.02 as per the example. The rationale should explain the selection, like choosing a baseline, a selection method, and a weighted approach for diversity.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, per-horizon selection for adaptability, and inverse-RMSE weighting to leverage model-specific strengths while balancing performance across RMSE, SMAPE, and direction accuracy.\"}"
