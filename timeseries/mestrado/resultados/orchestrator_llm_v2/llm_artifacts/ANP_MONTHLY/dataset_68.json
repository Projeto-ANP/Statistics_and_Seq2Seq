      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that the best models per horizon are things like ONLY_DWT_catboost, THETA, and others. But the recommended candidates are more about combining these models. The user instruction says to select candidate names from the candidate_library and choose a score_preset.\n\nLooking at the score_presets, there's balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. The balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Since the user didn't specify a particular focus, maybe balanced is a safe choice.\n\nNow, the task is to select at least three candidates. The recommended_candidates list has five, so I can pick from those. The baseline_mean is a good starting point as it's a simple average. Then, best_per_horizon_by_validation and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 are both selection methods. Adding inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 would cover weighted and stacking approaches.\n\nWait, the output example shows selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user wants at least three. So I need to pick three or more. Let me check the candidate_library again. The recommended_candidates include five, so selecting three from them makes sense. Maybe baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. But the user might prefer a mix of different types. Alternatively, the topk_mean and ridge stacking could be good.\n\nAlso, the rationale should explain the choice. Since the validation has some disagreement (relative spread mean is 0.14), using a combination of methods might be better. The balanced score_preset would consider multiple metrics. So selecting baseline_mean (simple), best_per_horizon (selection), and inverse_rmse_weights (weighted) could cover different strategies. That's three candidates. Alternatively, adding ridge_stacking for a fourth. But the user said at least three, so three is okay.\n\nI need to make sure the names are exactly as in the candidate_library. The recommended_candidates list includes those names. So the selected_names would be baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. The score_preset is balanced. No force_debate unless there's a close call, but the example didn't mention that. So the JSON would have those three names, balanced preset, and a rationale explaining the selection based on diversity and metrics.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for simplicity, best_per_horizon_by_validation for adaptive selection, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 to leverage weighted ensemble with shrinkage.
