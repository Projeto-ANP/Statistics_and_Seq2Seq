      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library in the tool response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any new ones. Also, they prefer at least three candidates. The output JSON needs to have selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the first three are baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. These are all valid and part of the library. The score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice unless specified otherwise. The rationale should explain why these were chosen. Since the user mentioned horizon_heterogeneous in the meta flags, maybe the best_per_horizon and topk_mean are good for handling different horizons. Also, the baseline_mean is a safe choice.\n\nI should check if there are other candidates that might be better. The inverse_rmse and ridge_stacking are also options, but the user might want a mix of different types. However, the instructions say to prefer at least three, so maybe pick the first three from the recommended list. The params_overrides might not be needed unless specified, but the example in output_schema shows an override for topk_mean_per_horizon_k3. However, in the recommended_candidates, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is suggested with top_k=5. Maybe the user wants to stick with the default parameters unless there's a reason to change them. Since the example in the tool response has params_overrides, but the user hasn't specified any, maybe leave it as empty.\n\nSo, the selected_names would be baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The score_preset is \"balanced\" as it's a standard choice. The rationale could mention the balance between simplicity and horizon-specific performance. Also, since the validation_summary shows that some models perform better in certain horizons, using best_per_horizon and topk_mean would leverage that. The force_debate and debate_margin can be set to false and 0.02 as defaults unless there's a reason to debate, but the user hasn't indicated that.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, best_per_horizon_by_validation to leverage horizon-specific model strengths, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to balance performance across top models.
