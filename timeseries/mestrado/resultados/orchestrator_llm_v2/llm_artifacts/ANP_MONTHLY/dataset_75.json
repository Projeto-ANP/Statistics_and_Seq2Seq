      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's some disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of around 0.196. The best models per horizon vary, so maybe a combination approach would be better than relying on a single model. The recommended candidates include both selection methods (like topk_mean) and weighted methods (inverse_rmse_weights) as well as stacking (ridge_stacking).\n\nSince the user prefers at least 3 candidates, I should pick a few from the recommended list. The baseline_mean is a safe choice as a starting point. Then, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are both good options for combining models. Ridge_stacking might be more complex but could offer better performance if the data allows. However, with only 3 windows, there's a risk of instability, so maybe stick to the topk and inverse_rmse methods. Also, the score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice unless specified otherwise. I need to make sure not to include any candidates not in the library. Let me check the names again. Yes, those are all there. So the selected_names would be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. The score_preset is balanced. No need for force_debate since the margin is small and the selection is reasonable.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline combination, top-k averaging for stability, and inverse-RMSE weighting with moderate shrinkage to balance model performance and regularization\"}"
