      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library in the tool response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models with varying RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID values. The best models per horizon include catboost, THETA, ETS, and some others. The disagreement metrics indicate a relative spread mean of around 18.7%, which isn't extremely high, but there's some variation.\n\nSince the user prefers at least 3 candidates, I should pick a few from the recommended ones. The baseline_mean is a safe choice as a starting point. Then, considering the best_single_by_validation and best_per_horizon_by_validation could be good selections since they leverage past validation results. Also, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is recommended, which averages the top 5 models per horizon. The inverse_rmse_weights and ridge_stacking are more complex methods that might offer better performance but could be riskier with few windows.\n\nThe score_preset should be balanced as it's a general approach. I need to make sure not to include any candidates not in the library. Let me check the names again. Yes, the selected names are all present. The rationale should explain the choices, mentioning the balance between simplicity and more sophisticated methods, using the recommended candidates.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_single_by_validation\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline and top recommended strategies: simple mean for stability, single best model for simplicity, per-horizon selection for adaptability, and top-5 averaging for robustness.
