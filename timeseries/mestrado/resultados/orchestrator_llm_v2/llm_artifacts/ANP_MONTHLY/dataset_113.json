    "raw": {
      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any new ones. Also, I need to prefer at least three candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The first one is baseline_mean, which is a simple average. Then there's best_per_horizon_by_validation, which selects the best model for each horizon. The third is topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, averaging the top 5 models. The fourth is inverse_rmse_weights with shrinkage, and the fifth is ridge stacking.\n\nI should pick a few of these. Maybe start with baseline_mean as a conservative choice. Then include best_per_horizon_by_validation since it's recommended. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is also a good candidate. For the weighted methods, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 might be a good choice. But the user said to prefer at least three, so maybe select three from the recommended list. Also, the score_preset can be \"balanced\" as per the example. The rationale should explain the selection based on the validation summary and recommended candidates. I need to make sure not to include any candidates not in the library. Let me confirm the names again. Yes, those are all in the candidate_library. Alright, I'll structure the JSON with those names and the balanced preset.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for stability, best_per_horizon_by_validation for adaptive selection, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for robust averaging, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for weighted ensemble based on validation performance.\"}",
      "skeptic": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to act as an anti-leakage skeptic/auditor. The main task is to evaluate the debate packet and decide on adding or removing candidates based on the provided tool output. The key is to avoid using y_true from the same window being evaluated.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the current_candidate_names: [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"]. The valid_candidate_names include various other models like \"inverse_rmse_weights_k10_sh0.35\" and others, but I can only add names from the valid list.\n\nLooking at the tool response, the candidate_ranking_top shows that \"baseline_mean\" is the top performer with a score of 0.6848. The next is \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" with 0.6927, then \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\" at 0.6937, and \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" at 0.7088. The score margin between the top two is 0.0078, which is small, indicating close competition.\n\nThe per_horizon_winners show that \"baseline_mean\" wins in most metrics (RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE), but \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\" also have some wins. However, the stability flags for \"baseline_mean\" indicate it's unstable (rmse_std_over_rmse is 0.273, which is over 0.25, suggesting high variance). This might mean that while it's currently leading, its performance isn't consistent across windows.\n\nThe recommended_knobs suggest using top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.1. This might relate to the parameters of the models, but since the user can't change the method, I need to focus on candidate selection.\n\nLooking at the universe's leaderboards, \"best_single_by_validation\" has a lower RMSE (88.18) compared to \"baseline_mean\" (90.27). However, \"best_single_by_validation\" isn't in the current candidates. Since the allowed_edits allow adding candidates, maybe adding \"best_single_by_validation\" could be beneficial. But wait, the user's current_candidate_names don't include it, and the tool's universe does have it. However, the user's instruction says to only add names from valid_candidate_names, which includes \"best_single_by_validation\".\n\nBut the problem is that the current candidates are already in the list, and the tool's output shows that \"best_single_by_validation\" is in the universe. However, the user's current_candidate_names don't include it. So, should I add it? The rationale would be that it has a better RMSE in the leaderboards. However, the user's allowed_edits say can_add_candidates is true, so adding it is allowed.\n\nBut wait, the user's current_candidate_names are [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"]. The \"best_single_by_validation\" is not in there. However, the tool's output shows that \"best_single_by_validation\" is in the universe and has a better RMSE. But the user's current candidates don't include it. However, the user's instruction says that I can add candidates only from the valid_candidate_names. Since \"best_single_by_validation\" is in valid_candidate_names, adding it is allowed.\n\nBut the problem is that the user's current_candidate_names don't include it. However, the tool's output shows that \"best_single_by_validation\" is in the universe and has a better RMSE. However, the user's current candidates are the ones being evaluated. But the user's instruction says that I can add candidates from the valid list. So, adding \"best_single_by_validation\" might be a good idea if it's not already in the current list.\n\nWait, but the user's current_candidate_names are the ones that are being considered. The tool's output includes \"best_single_by_validation\" in the universe's ranking_top. However, the current_candidate_names don't include it. So, adding it could potentially improve the performance. However, the user's allowed_edits say can_add_candidates is true, so that's allowed.\n\nBut the user's instruction says that I must only use candidate names from valid_candidate_names. Since \"best_single_by_validation\" is in valid_candidate_names, adding it is allowed. However, the current_candidate_names don't include it, so adding it would be a valid action.\n\nBut wait, the user's current_candidate_names are the ones that are being evaluated. The tool's output shows that \"best_single_by_validation\" is in the universe and has a better RMSE. However, the user's current candidates don't include it. So, adding it might be beneficial. However, the user's allowed_edits say can_add_candidates is true, so that's allowed.\n\nBut the user's instruction says that I must not use y_true from the same window. However, the tool's output is based on evaluation, so the candidates are evaluated on different windows. Therefore, adding \"best_single_by_validation\" is allowed as it's part of the valid_candidate_names.\n\nBut looking at the candidate_ranking_top in the tool's output, \"best_single_by_validation\" has a score of 0.6726, which is lower than the current candidates. However, in the leaderboards, \"best_single_by_validation\" has a lower RMSE. This might be due to different metrics. The score is a combination of RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. So, even though \"best_single_by_validation\" has a better RMSE, its overall score is lower. Therefore, adding it might not be beneficial.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the universe's leaderboards, \"best_single_by_validation\" is the top in RMSE, but the current candidates have higher scores in other metrics. However, the user's current candidates include \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\" which is in the top of the candidate_ranking_top. The score for \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\" is 0.6937, which is higher than \"best_single_by_validation\" (0.6726). So, maybe \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\" is better overall.\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names include \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", so no need to add it. However, the current_candidate_names also include \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" which has a score of 0.6927, which is slightly lower than \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\" (0.6937). The difference is small, but maybe \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\" is better.\n\nThe recommended_knobs suggest using top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.1. The current_candidate_names include \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" which has shrinkage=0.35 and l2=50.0 (assuming that the parameters are set accordingly). However, the user's allowed_edits allow changing parameters, but the user's instruction says not to change params.method. So, the parameters can be adjusted, but the method can't be changed.\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names include \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" which might already be using the recommended parameters. However, the tool's output shows that \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" has a score of 0.6927, which is slightly lower than \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\" (0.6937). The difference is minimal, but maybe \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\" is better.\n\nIn terms of removing candidates, the current_candidate_names include \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" and \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\". The \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" has a score of 0.7088, which is higher than the others. However, the score margin between the top two is 0.0078, which is small. But since \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" has a higher score than \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", maybe it's better to keep it.\n\nHowever, looking at the per_horizon_winners, \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" has some wins in RMSE, but \"baseline_mean\" wins more. However, the overall score for \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" is higher than \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" but lower than \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\".\n\nThe stability flags for \"baseline_mean\" indicate it's unstable, which might be a reason to consider removing it. However, the user's instruction says that I can only remove candidates that are in the current_candidate_names. Since \"baseline_mean\" is in the current_candidate_names, maybe removing it could be considered if there's a better candidate. But \"baseline_mean\" is the current best, so removing it might not be advisable unless there's a clear reason.\n\nThe recommended_knobs suggest using trim_ratio=0.1, which is in the current_candidate_names as \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\" (but that's not in the current list). However, the current_candidate_names don't include \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\", so adding it might be beneficial. But the user's current_candidate_names don't have it, and the allowed_edits say can_add_candidates is true. However, the tool's output shows that \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\" is in the universe's leaderboards for SMAPE and MAPE, but not sure if adding it would help.\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names are [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"]. The tool's output shows that \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\" is in the universe and has a RMSE of 90.6479, which is worse than \"baseline_mean\" (90.27). So adding it might not be beneficial.\n\nIn conclusion, the current candidates are performing reasonably, but \"baseline_mean\" is unstable. However, since it's the current best, removing it might not be advisable. The other candidates are close in score. The recommended_knobs suggest parameters that are already in use by some candidates. Therefore, no changes might be necessary, or maybe adding \"best_single_by_validation\" if it's not already in the current list. But \"best_single_by_validation\" is not in the current_candidate_names, and adding it could potentially improve the performance. However, its score is lower than the current candidates, so maybe not. Alternatively, since the score margin between the top two is small, maybe keeping the current candidates is better.\n\nThe user's instruction says that if uncertain, return the default JSON with no changes. Given the close scores and the instability of \"baseline_mean\", but it's still the top performer, perhaps no changes are needed. Therefore, the output would be to not add or remove any candidates, keep the current ones, and note that the current setup is stable.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [], \"remove_names\": [], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"rationale\": \"Current candidates show stable performance with minimal score differences. Baseline_mean remains top despite instability flags, and other candidates are closely ranked. No clear improvement from adding/removing candidates.\", \"changes\": [], \"when_good\": \"Stable\"}",
      "statistician": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to build a debate packet tool first, then return a JSON with specific keys. The current candidate names are [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"]. The valid candidates include various inverse_rmse_weights and ridge_stacking, trimmed_mean, etc.\n\nLooking at the tool response, the recommended knobs suggest top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.1. Since the current candidates have inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, which matches the shrinkage of 0.35 and top_k=5. But maybe there are better candidates. The leaderboards in the universe show that \"best_single_by_validation\" has a lower RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. However, the current candidates don't include \"best_single_by_validation\" yet. But the allowed edits say can_add_candidates is true. Wait, but the user's current_candidate_names don't have that. However, the valid_candidate_names include \"best_single_by_validation\". So maybe I should add it.\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names are limited. The tool's recommended_knobs say to use stronger regularization/shrinkage because of few windows (n_windows=3). The current candidates include inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, which already uses shrinkage 0.35. However, looking at the universe's leaderboards, \"best_single_by_validation\" is better. But the current candidates don't have it. However, the allowed edits allow adding candidates. So maybe adding \"best_single_by_validation\" would be good. But the user's current_candidate_names don't have it. Wait, the valid_candidate_names include \"best_single_by_validation\", so it's allowed.\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names are [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"]. The tool's recommended_knobs suggest using top_k=5, which is already in the current candidates as \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\". However, the \"best_single_by_validation\" might be better. But the user might not have it in their current candidates. However, the allowed edits say can_add_candidates is true. So maybe adding \"best_single_by_validation\" would be beneficial.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to only add candidates from the valid_candidate_names. Since \"best_single_by_validation\" is in the valid list, it's allowed. However, the current_candidate_names don't have it. So adding it could be a good move. Also, the \"best_single_by_validation\" has a lower score than the current candidates. But the current candidates include \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", which is a selection method. However, the \"best_single_by_validation\" is also a selection method. Maybe adding it would improve the debate packet.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the candidate_ranking_top, \"baseline_mean\" is the best, but it's unstable. The recommended_knobs suggest using stronger regularization. The current candidates have inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, which is a weighted method with shrinkage 0.35. The leaderboards in the universe show that \"best_single_by_validation\" is better. But since the user can add candidates, maybe adding it would help. However, the user's current_candidate_names don't include it. But the allowed edits allow adding. So perhaps adding \"best_single_by_validation\" and \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\" (since trim_ratio is 0.1 as per recommended_knobs) could be beneficial.\n\nWait, the recommended_knobs suggest trim_ratio=0.1, so maybe adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\" would be good. Also, the current candidates don't have any trimmed_mean. The valid_candidate_names include \"trimmed_mean_r0.05\", \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\", etc. So adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\" would align with the recommended trim_ratio.\n\nAdditionally, the recommended_knobs suggest l2=50.0, so looking at the valid_candidate_names, there's \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk3\" and \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\". Since the recommended top_k is 5, adding \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" would be appropriate.\n\nSo, possible additions: \"best_single_by_validation\", \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\".\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names are limited. However, the allowed edits allow adding. But the user might not want to add too many. Alternatively, maybe removing some candidates. For example, \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" has a higher score than \"baseline_mean\" but lower than \"best_single_by_validation\". However, the current candidates include \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", which is a selection method. But \"best_single_by_validation\" might be better.\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names don't have \"best_single_by_validation\", so adding it would be a good idea. Also, the recommended_knobs suggest using trim_ratio=0.1, so adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\" would be good. And adding \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" for l2=50 and top_k=5.\n\nHowever, the user's current_candidate_names are [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"]. So adding \"best_single_by_validation\", \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" would be valid.\n\nBut the user might not want to add too many. Alternatively, maybe just adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\" and \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" as they align with the recommended knobs. Also, the current candidate \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" already uses shrinkage 0.35 and top_k=5, which matches the recommended knobs. However, the \"ridge_stacking\" with l2=50 and topk=5 might be better.\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names don't have \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", so adding it would be good. Also, the \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\" would be good for trim_ratio=0.1.\n\nSo, the add_names would be [\"best_single_by_validation\", \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"].\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names may not have these. However, the allowed edits say can_add_candidates is true. So that's allowed.\n\nBut the user might not want to add too many. Alternatively, maybe only adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\" and \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" as they are more aligned with the recommended knobs. Also, the \"best_single_by_validation\" is a selection method, but the current candidate \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\" is also a selection method. However, \"best_single_by_validation\" might be better.\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names include \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", which is a selection method. However, \"best_single_by_validation\" is another selection method. Maybe adding it would be redundant, but perhaps it's better.\n\nAlternatively, considering the stability, the current \"baseline_mean\" is unstable. The recommended_knobs suggest stronger regularization, so adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\" and \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" would help with stability.\n\nSo, the add_names would be [\"trimmed_mean_r0.10\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], and maybe \"best_single_by_validation\" if it's better.\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names don't have \"best_single_by_validation\", but it's in the valid_candidate_names. So adding it is allowed.\n\nBut the user might not want to add too many. However, the tool's recommended_knobs suggest using trim_ratio=0.1 and l2=50. So adding those two candidates would be good.\n\nAlso, looking at the leaderboards in the universe, \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\" has a RMSE of 90.6479, which is worse than \"baseline_mean\" (90.27), but maybe with the recommended knobs, it's better. However, the current candidate \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" has RMSE 91.87, which is worse than \"baseline_mean\".\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names include \"baseline_mean\", which is the best in the current ranking. However, the stability flags say \"unstable\": true. So maybe adding more stable candidates would help.\n\nThe \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\" has a RMSE of 90.65, which is slightly worse than \"baseline_mean\", but maybe more stable. The \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" is not in the current candidates, but in the universe's leaderboards, \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" isn't listed. However, the recommended_knobs suggest using l2=50 and top_k=5, so adding that would be good.\n\nSo, the add_names would be [\"trimmed_mean_r0.10\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], and maybe \"best_single_by_validation\".\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names may not have these. However, the allowed edits allow adding. So the final answer would be adding those candidates, and possibly removing some that are less effective.\n\nLooking at the current_candidate_names, \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" has a score of 0.7088, which is higher than \"baseline_mean\" (0.6848). But \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" is a selection method. However, the \"best_single_by_validation\" has a lower score (0.6726) in the universe's ranking. So adding \"best_single_by_validation\" would be better.\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names don't have it. So adding it would be good.\n\nSo, the add_names would be [\"best_single_by_validation\", \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], and maybe remove \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" if it's not as good.\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names include \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", which is a selection method. However, the \"best_single_by_validation\" is a better selection method. So removing \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and adding \"best_single_by_validation\" would be better.\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names include \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", which is another selection method. However, \"best_single_by_validation\" might be better.\n\nSo, the changes would be adding \"best_single_by_validation\", \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", and removing \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\".\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names have \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", which is allowed to be removed.\n\nSo, the JSON would have add_names as [\"best_single_by_validation\", \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], remove_names as [\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], and params_overrides as per the recommended_knobs: top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.1. But the user's current params might not have these, but the allowed edits say can't change method. Wait, the allowed_edits say cannot_change_method, but the params_allowed include top_k, trim_ratio, shrinkage, l2. So the params_overrides would be {\"top_k\":5, \"shrinkage\":0.35, \"l2\":50.0, \"trim_ratio\":0.1}.\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names may not have these parameters set. However, the tool's recommended_knobs suggest these values, so overriding them would be appropriate.\n\nSo, the final JSON would include adding the best_single_by_validation, trimmed_mean_r0.10, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, removing topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and overriding the parameters to the recommended values.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [\"best_single_by_validation\", \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"remove_names\": [\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"top_k\": 5, \"shrinkage\": 0.35, \"l2\": 50.0, \"trim_ratio\": 0.1}, \"rationale\": \"Recommended knobs applied for few windows (n_windows=3): stronger regularization (shrinkage=0.35, l2=50), trim_ratio=0.1.
