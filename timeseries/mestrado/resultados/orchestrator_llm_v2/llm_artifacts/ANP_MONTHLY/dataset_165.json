      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any new ones. Also, I should prefer at least three candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there are five options here. The output_schema example shows selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user wants at least three.\n\nI need to pick three or more from the recommended list. Let me check the descriptions. The baseline_mean is a simple average, which is a good baseline. The best_per_horizon_by_validation selects the best model for each horizon, which might be effective given the validation_summary's best_per_horizon data. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 averages the top 5 models, which could smooth out some errors. The inverse_rmse_weights and ridge_stacking are more complex methods that might perform better but could be unstable with few windows. Since the n_windows is 3, maybe the simpler methods are safer.\n\nBut the user also mentioned that if uncertain, to return baseline_mean with a balanced score_preset. However, the example output has selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user wants at least three. Wait, the user's instruction says \"prefer returning at least 3 candidates.\" So maybe I should pick three from the recommended list. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nSo selecting three of these. Maybe baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The score_preset could be \"balanced\" as per the example. The rationale would be that these methods provide a mix of baseline, selection, and averaging strategies, covering different approaches. Also, the force_debate and debate_margin can be set to false and 0.02 as defaults unless specified otherwise. \n\nI need to make sure that the selected_names are exactly from the candidate_library. The names in the recommended_candidates are all present in the candidate_library. So the JSON should have selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], params_overrides as empty, score_preset as \"balanced\", force_debate as false, debate_margin as 0.02, and the rationale explaining the selection.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline, per-horizon selection, and top-k averaging strategies to balance robustness and adaptability across horizons.\"}"
