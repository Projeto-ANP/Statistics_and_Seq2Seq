      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models vary per horizon. The disagreement metrics indicate high spread, so maybe using a combination approach would be better than relying on a single model. The recommended candidates include baseline methods like mean and median, selection methods like best_per_horizon, and weighted methods like inverse_rmse_weights.\n\nLooking at the candidate_library, there are several options. The user mentioned preferring at least 3 candidates. The recommended_candidates section lists baseline_mean, robust_median, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nI should select candidates that cover different approaches: a baseline, a selection method, and a weighted or stacking method. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. The best_per_horizon_by_validation is good for selection. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is a weighted method that uses shrinkage, which might handle the high disagreement. Also, the ridge_stacking could be a good addition as it's a stacking method. However, the user might want to limit to 3. Let me check the score_presets. The balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. \n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. These cover baseline, selection, and weighting. The rationale would be that they balance different aspects of performance. Also, the score_preset is balanced as it's a general approach. I need to make sure the names are from the candidate_library. Yes, they are there. The params_overrides might not be needed unless specified, but the user didn't mention any, so leave it as default. Force_debate is false unless there's a need, but with the selected candidates, it's probably not necessary. The debate_margin is 0.02 as default.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, per-horizon selection for adaptability, and inverse-RMSE weighting to leverage model performance while mitigating overfitting through shrinkage.\"}"
