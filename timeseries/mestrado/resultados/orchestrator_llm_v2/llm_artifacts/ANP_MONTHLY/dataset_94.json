      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose a multi-step combination strategy based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation summary shows that there are 26 models, and the best models per horizon vary. For example, \"ONLY_DWT_rf\" is the best for the first horizon, \"ARIMA\" for the second, and so on. The disagreement metrics indicate a relative spread mean of about 12.8%, which isn't extremely high, but there's some variation. The recommended candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidates from the candidate_library and choose a score_preset. The output JSON needs selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the top ones are baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. The score presets available are balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape.\n\nSince the user didn't specify a particular focus, maybe \"balanced\" is a safe choice. The rationale should explain the selection. The force_debate and debate_margin are optional, but the user might not need them unless there's a close call between candidates. Since the recommended candidates are from the tool's suggestions, I can select those. Let me check the candidate_library to ensure the names match.\n\nYes, \"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", and \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" are all in the candidate_library. The user wants at least three candidates, so selecting the top three from the recommended list makes sense. However, the example output in the tool's output_schema shows \"baseline_mean\" and \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k3\" with a params override. But the user's instruction says to prefer at least three candidates.\n\nWait, the output_schema example might be just an example. The actual recommended_candidates have five entries. So, selecting three from those. Let me pick \"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", and \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" as the selected_names. The score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. The rationale would be that these candidates balance simplicity, horizon-specific selection, and averaging top models, which aligns with the balanced preset.\n\nI need to make sure that the params_overrides are correct. The example has a params override for \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k3\" with top_k=3, but in our case, the selected candidate is \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" with top_k=5, which is already in the params. So no override is needed unless there's a change. Since the user didn't specify any overrides, maybe leave params_overrides as empty. However, the example includes an override, but perhaps that's just an example. The instructions say not to change params.method, but other parameters can be adjusted if needed. Since the selected candidates' parameters are already set in the candidate_library, maybe no overrides are necessary.\n\nSo the final JSON would have selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], score_preset as \"balanced\", and rationale explaining the selection. Also, since the user didn't mention needing a debate, force_debate is false and debate_margin is 0.02 as default.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, best_per_horizon_by_validation for adaptive horizon-specific selection, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to leverage ensemble stability.
