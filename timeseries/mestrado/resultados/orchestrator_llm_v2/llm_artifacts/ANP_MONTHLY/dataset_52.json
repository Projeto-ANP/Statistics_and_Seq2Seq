      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library. The output JSON needs selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale. The example shows selecting at least three candidates. \n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, there are five options. Let me check their types. Baseline_mean is a baseline method, best_per_horizon is a selection method, topk_mean is another selection, inverse_rmse is weighted, and ridge_stacking is stacking. \n\nThe score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. The user might prefer a balanced approach unless specified otherwise. The example uses \"balanced\" as the default. \n\nI should select three or more candidates. Let's pick baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. These cover different strategies: baseline, selection, and weighted. Also, the rationale should explain the choice. \n\nCheck if the names are in the candidate_library. Yes, they are. The params_overrides might not be needed here unless specified. The example has an empty params_overrides, so maybe leave it as default. \n\nForce_debate is false by default, and debate_margin is 0.02. The rationale could mention selecting diverse methods to balance performance and robustness. \n\nSo the final JSON would have selected_names as those three, score_preset as balanced, and the rationale explaining the selection.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected diverse strategies: baseline for simplicity, per-horizon selection for adaptability, and weighted inverse-RMSE for robust aggregation.\"}"
