      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library in the tool response. The recommended_candidates include several options like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's a fair amount of disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of 0.44. The best models vary per horizon, so maybe a strategy that combines top performers would be good. The recommended_candidates include both baseline methods and more complex ones like ridge stacking.\n\nI need to select at least three candidates. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then, considering the high disagreement, maybe the trimmed_mean_r0.20 from the candidate_library could help by reducing outliers. Also, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is recommended as it averages top models per horizon, which might handle the variability. Additionally, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 uses weights based on RMSE, which could be effective. However, the user said to prefer at least three, so maybe pick three from the recommended ones. Wait, the output_schema example has selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user instruction says to prefer at least three. Let me check the candidate_library again.\n\nLooking at the candidate_library's recommended_candidates, there's baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean_r0.20, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. So selecting three from these. Maybe baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Alternatively, include the ridge stacking as well. But the user said to return at least three. Also, the score_preset can be \"balanced\" as per the example. The rationale should explain the selection based on the validation results and the need to handle disagreement.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for stability, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to leverage top models per horizon, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for adaptive weighting based on RMSE.
