      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's high disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of around 1.06 and a p90 of 1.85. This suggests that models vary a lot in their performance, so maybe strategies that aggregate or select the best models would be good. The best_per_horizon_by_validation and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 are selection methods that could handle this variability. The inverse_rmse_weights and ridge stacking are weighted methods that might also perform well by giving more weight to better models.\n\nLooking at the score_presets, the balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Since the user didn't specify a particular focus, maybe starting with the balanced preset is a safe choice. The recommended_candidates include a mix of baseline, selection, and weighted methods, so selecting a few from each category could provide a good balance.\n\nI need to make sure the selected_names are from the candidate_library. The top candidates could be baseline_mean for simplicity, best_per_horizon_by_validation for selection, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for weighted averaging, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 for stacking. However, the output_schema example only has one selected name. Wait, the user instruction says to return at least 3 candidates. Let me check the example again.\n\nThe output_schema example shows selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"], but the user rules say to prefer at least 3. Maybe the user wants multiple strategies. Looking back, the recommended_candidates have several options. Let me pick three: baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. These cover baseline, selection, and weighted methods. The score_preset would be \"balanced\" as a default. Also, since there's high disagreement, maybe force_debate is not needed unless the scores are very close. The debate_margin is set to 0.02 by default. The rationale should explain the selection based on the high disagreement and the need for robust methods.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, best_per_horizon_by_validation to leverage horizon-specific model strength, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 to dynamically weight models based on validation performance.
