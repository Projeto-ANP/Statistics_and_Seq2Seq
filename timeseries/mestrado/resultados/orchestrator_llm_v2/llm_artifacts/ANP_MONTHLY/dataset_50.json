      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and prefer at least 3 candidates. The score_preset can be one of the provided options like balanced, rmse_focus, etc. Also, if unsure, default to baseline_mean with balanced preset.\n\nLooking at the validation_summary, the best models per horizon include NaiveSeasonal, ONLY_CWT_catboost, ETS, FT_rf, etc. But the recommended candidates are more about combining models rather than single ones. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 seem like good choices as they average top models or use weights. Ridge stacking is another method that combines models with regularization.\n\nI should pick three candidates. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then maybe the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Alternatively, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 could be included. The score_preset could be balanced since it's a general approach. The rationale should mention combining top models and using weighted approaches for robustness.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline averaging, top-k model ensemble, and inverse-RMSE weighted combination to balance robustness and adaptability across horizons\"}"
