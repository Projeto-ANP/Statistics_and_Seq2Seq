      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the tool output. First, I need to look at the candidate_library from the proposer_brief tool's response. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any new ones. Also, they prefer at least three candidates. The output JSON needs to have selected_names, params_overrides, score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, baseline_mean is a good starting point as it's a simple baseline. Then, best_per_horizon_by_validation and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 are both selection methods that might perform well. The inverse_rmse_weights and ridge_stacking are more complex methods that could add value. However, the user might want a mix of different approaches.\n\nThe score_preset options are balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the validation_summary shows that RMSE is a key metric, maybe \"rmse_focus\" is appropriate. But the recommended_candidates include methods that might balance different metrics. However, the user might prefer a balanced approach unless specified otherwise.\n\nThe rationale should explain the selection. Since the tool's recommended_candidates include a variety of methods, selecting those could be justified. However, the user might want to ensure that the selected candidates are from the library and not just the recommended ones. Wait, the output_schema in the tool's response shows selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\"] and params_overrides for topk_mean_per_horizon_k3. But the user's instruction says to select from the candidate_library, which includes more options.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says to select from the candidate_library.candidates, not just the recommended_candidates. The candidate_library has a lot more entries, like trimmed_mean variants, topk_mean with different k values, inverse_rmse with various shrinkages, and ridge_stacking with different parameters.\n\nBut the recommended_candidates are a subset of the candidate_library. However, the user might want to pick from the broader library. However, the tool's output includes a \"recommended_candidates\" section, which might be the ones the proposer_brief tool suggests. But the user's instruction says to select from the candidate_library.candidates, so I need to check which ones are in there.\n\nLooking at the candidate_library.candidates, there's a \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" which is in the recommended_candidates. Also, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" and \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" are present. The \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\" is also in the candidate_library.\n\nSo, selecting these three: baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Also, maybe include the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 for more diversity. But the user said to prefer at least three. Let's pick three from the recommended ones. The score_preset could be \"balanced\" as a default. The rationale would be that these candidates offer a mix of baseline, selection-based, and weighted approaches, leveraging different strategies to combine models effectively.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline, per-horizon selection, and top-k averaging strategies to balance simplicity, adaptability, and robustness across horizons.\"}"
