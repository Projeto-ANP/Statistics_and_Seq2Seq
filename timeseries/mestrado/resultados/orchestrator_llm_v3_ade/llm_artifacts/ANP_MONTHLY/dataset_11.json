      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among the models. The recommended_knobs suggest candidates like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_single, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, and inverse_rmse_weights. \n\nLooking at the candidate_library, there are a lot of options. The user wants at least 3 candidates. The score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. \n\nSince the validation has high disagreement (as per meta.flags.high_disagreement: true), maybe a method that averages top models would be good. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are in the recommended_candidates. Also, the baseline_mean is a safe choice. \n\nI should check the params_overrides. For topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, the top_k is already 5, so maybe no need to override. But if there's a recommended top_k from validation_summary, I should use that. The recommended_knobs have top_k=5, so that's probably okay. \n\nThe score_preset could be balanced since it's a general approach. The rationale should mention selecting candidates that handle disagreement and use top models. Also, considering the number of windows is 3, which is low, maybe the topk_mean with a reasonable k and inverse_rmse with shrinkage would be stable. \n\nSo, selected_names could be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Check if these are in the candidate_library. Yes, they are. Also, ensure that params_overrides are set correctly. Since the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, and the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35, which are already in their params, no overrides needed. \n\nTherefore, the JSON should include these three names, balanced score_preset, and a rationale explaining the choice based on high disagreement and stability with few windows.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to leverage top-performing models, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 to weight models by inverse RMSE with shrinkage.
