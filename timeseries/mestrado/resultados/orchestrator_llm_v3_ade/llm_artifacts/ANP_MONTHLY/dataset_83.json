      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and others with inverse RMSE weights and ridge stacking.\n\nI need to select candidates from the candidate_library. The example given in the rules mentions selecting at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there are a few that stand out. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are recommended. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is there. \n\nWait, the user's example had \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" with top_k set to 7. But in the recommended_candidates, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5. The validation_summary's recommended_knobs have top_k=5. So maybe I should use that. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is in the recommended_candidates. \n\nI should check if the params_overrides are needed. For example, if a candidate's params include top_k, I need to set it explicitly. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 already has top_k=5, so maybe no override. But the example in the rules had top_k=7, but here it's 5. Wait, the user's example was just an example. The actual top_k should be based on the validation_summary and recommended_knobs. The recommended_knobs mention top_k=5, so that's probably the right value.\n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and maybe ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the user said to prefer at least 3 candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates list again. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, topk_mean_per_horizon_k8, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0.\n\nBut the user's example had 3 candidates. Maybe pick the top ones. The score_preset is balanced, which is the default. The rationale should explain the selection. Since the validation has some disagreement, maybe using a combination of selection and weighted methods. So, selecting baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the user said to return at least 3. Let me check if those are in the candidate_library. Yes, they are. Also, the params_overrides might not be needed if the top_k is already set. But in the candidate_library, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which is correct. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35. So no overrides needed. \n\nSo the selected_names would be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and maybe ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example had 3. Let me go with three for now. The rationale would be that these candidates balance between simplicity, top-k selection, and weighted averaging, which are suitable given the validation results.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for leveraging top-performing models, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for adaptive weighting based on validation performance.\"}"
