      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed choice.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best_per_horizon has some models winning in different horizons, and the disagreement is relatively high with a mean spread of 0.27. The recommended_candidates include several options like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, and various weighted methods.\n\nSince the disagreement is high, maybe a method that combines multiple models would be better. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are recommended. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is there. But I need to check the parameters. The user mentioned to select at least 3 candidates.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are good options. Also, maybe the best_per_horizon_by_validation. But the example in the instructions used topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 with top_k set to 7. However, in the recommended_knobs, the top_k is 5. Wait, the user said to use the validation_summary and recommended_knobs. The recommended_knobs have top_k=5, so I should use that.\n\nSo, selected_names could be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, maybe the best_per_horizon_by_validation. But the example had two candidates. The user said to prefer at least 3. Let me check the candidate_library. The recommended_candidates include best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others. So including those three would be good. Also, the score_preset is balanced as per the example. The rationale would be based on the high disagreement and the need for robust methods.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected robust combination strategies to handle high model disagreement: baseline_mean for stability, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for diversified averaging, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for adaptive weighting based on validation performance.\"}",
      "skeptic": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to act as an auditor to evaluate the debate packet tool's output and decide on any changes to the candidate names and parameters. The current candidates are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The tool's response has a lot of data, so I need to parse through it carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the candidate rankings. The top candidates are baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Their scores are close, with inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 having the highest score (0.6667), followed by topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 (0.6620), and baseline_mean (0.6485). The score margin between the top two is about 0.0135, which is mentioned in the tool response. \n\nThe per-horizon winners show that inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 wins in some metrics like SMAPE and MAPE, while baseline_mean wins in RMSE. However, the stability flags for baseline_mean indicate that it's unstable with high RMSE_std. The recommended knobs suggest using top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.2. \n\nNow, considering the rules: I can't use any names not in valid_candidate_names. The current candidates are in the valid list. The task is to decide whether to add, remove, or override parameters. The user's instruction says to reject or rewrite strategies that use y_true from the same window. But I'm not sure how that applies here. Maybe it's about not using data from the same window for evaluation, which the tool's output already handles.\n\nLooking at the allowed edits, parameters like top_k, trim_ratio, shrinkage, and l2 can be adjusted. The current candidates might be using different parameters. For example, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has k=5 and shrinkage=0.35, which aligns with the recommended knobs. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 uses top_k=5, which is also recommended. Baseline_mean is a simple average, so maybe it's less optimal.\n\nThe stability of baseline_mean is flagged as unstable, so maybe it's better to remove it. The other two candidates are more stable. However, the tool's output shows that baseline_mean has a higher RMSE_std, which might make it less reliable. But the score is lower than the other two. However, the user's instruction is to be a skeptic/auditor, so maybe we should consider removing the less stable candidate.\n\nBut the current_candidate_names include baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The tool's recommended knobs suggest using top_k=5, which is already in topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 uses k=5 and shrinkage=0.35, which matches the recommendation. So maybe those two are already optimal. However, the baseline_mean might not be necessary if the other two are better.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to only remove candidates that are in the current list. Since baseline_mean is in the current list, and it's unstable, maybe it's a good candidate for removal. However, the tool's output shows that baseline_mean is the best in some metrics. But the score is lower than the other two. The rationale for removal would be instability.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adding other candidates from the valid list that align with the recommended parameters. For example, looking at the universe's leaderboards, there's a trimmed_mean_r0.20 with a score of 0.6443, but it's not in the current candidates. However, the allowed edits say can_add_candidates is true. But the user's instruction says to only add names from the tool-provided universe. So maybe adding trimmed_mean_r0.20 or others with trim_ratio=0.2 as recommended.\n\nBut the current candidates don't include those. However, the user's current_candidate_names are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The tool's recommended knobs suggest trim_ratio=0.2, which isn't used by the current candidates. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has shrinkage=0.35, which matches the recommendation. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 uses top_k=5, which is also recommended. But the trim_ratio for the current candidates isn't specified. Maybe the current candidates don't use trim_ratio, so adding a trimmed_mean with trim_ratio=0.2 could be better.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to only add names from the valid_candidate_names. Looking at the valid_candidate_names, there are entries like trimmed_mean_r0.20, which is in the list. So adding trimmed_mean_r0.20 might be a good idea. However, the current_candidate_names don't have it, so adding it would be allowed.\n\nBut the tool's output shows that the best candidate is baseline_mean, but it's unstable. However, the score of inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is higher. The user's instruction is to be a skeptic, so maybe removing baseline_mean and adding a better candidate. But the allowed edits say can_add_candidates is true, so adding trimmed_mean_r0.20 could be considered.\n\nAlternatively, since the current candidates are already using recommended parameters (top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35), maybe no changes are needed. However, the baseline_mean's instability might be a reason to remove it. The rationale would be that baseline_mean is unstable, and the other two are more stable. But the tool's output shows that inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has a lower RMSE_std (8.57) compared to baseline_mean's 1280. So that's a big difference. Therefore, removing baseline_mean and keeping the other two might be better.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to only remove candidates that are in the current list. So removing baseline_mean is allowed. Also, adding trimmed_mean_r0.20 could be considered, but the tool's output shows that trimmed_mean_r0.20 has a lower score than the current candidates. However, the recommended knobs suggest trim_ratio=0.2, which might be better. But the current candidates don't use trim_ratio. So maybe adding a trimmed_mean with trim_ratio=0.2 would be better.\n\nBut the current_candidate_names don't have any trimmed_mean entries. The valid_candidate_names include trimmed_mean_r0.05, trimmed_mean_r0.10, etc. So adding trimmed_mean_r0.20 could be a valid addition. However, the tool's output shows that trimmed_mean_r0.20 has a lower score than the current candidates. So maybe it's not better. Alternatively, the current candidates might not be using the optimal parameters, so adding a better one could help.\n\nBut the user's instruction is to be a skeptic, so maybe the current candidates are sufficient. However, the baseline_mean is unstable, so removing it would be a good move. The other two candidates are more stable. Therefore, the changes would be to remove baseline_mean and keep the other two. But the tool's output shows that inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has a higher score than topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. So maybe keeping inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and removing baseline_mean. But the user's current_candidate_names include both, so removing baseline_mean would be the action.\n\nSo the final decision is to remove baseline_mean from the current candidates, as it's unstable, and keep the other two. No additions are needed since the other candidates are already in the list. The rationale is that baseline_mean is unstable with high RMSE_std, and the other candidates are more stable and have higher scores.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [\"trimmed_mean_r0.20\"], \"remove_names\": [\"baseline_mean\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"trim_ratio\": 0.2, \"top_k\": 5, \"shrinkage\": 0.35}, \"rationale\": \"baseline_mean is unstable with high RMSE_std (1280). inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 align with recommended knobs (top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35).

The stability flags show that \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" is marked as unstable, so maybe adding more stable candidates would help. The recommended knobs suggest using trim_ratio=0.2, which is already in the current candidates. \n\nLooking at the allowed edits, we can add or remove candidates. The tool's universe includes other candidates like \"trimmed_mean_r0.15\" or \"trimmed_mean_r0.25\", but the recommended trim_ratio is 0.2, so maybe keeping \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" is better. However, the current candidates might not be optimal. \n\nThe user's current candidates are already using the recommended parameters. But the tool's best candidate is \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\", which is in the current list. However, the stability flags indicate it's unstable. Maybe adding other candidates with similar parameters but different configurations could improve stability. For example, \"trimmed_mean_r0.15\" or \"trimmed_mean_r0.25\" might offer better stability. But the recommended knob is trim_ratio=0.2, so perhaps sticking to that is better. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the leaderboards in the universe, \"best_single_by_validation\" has a lower RMSE. But the current candidates don't include that. However, the allowed edits say we can add candidates. But the user's instruction says to only use names from valid_candidate_names. The valid_candidate_names include \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\" and \"best_single_by_validation\". However, the current_candidate_names don't have these. \n\nWait, the user's current_candidate_names are [\"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\"], and the valid_candidate_names include \"best_single_by_validation\". So maybe adding that could be beneficial. But the tool's recommended_knobs suggest using trim_ratio=0.2, which is already in the current candidates. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to prefer stability when n_windows is small. The n_windows is 3, which is small. The current candidates might not be stable. The \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" is unstable. Maybe adding other trimmed means with different ratios could help, but the recommended is 0.2. Alternatively, looking at the universe's leaderboards, \"best_single_by_validation\" has a lower RMSE. However, the user's current candidates don't include that. \n\nBut the user's allowed edits allow adding candidates. However, the tool's recommended_knobs are already applied. The current candidates are using the recommended parameters. However, the stability is an issue. The tool's best candidate is \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" but it's marked as unstable. Maybe adding other candidates with shrinkage or l2 parameters could help. For example, \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" has l2=50 and topk=5, which matches the recommended l2 and top_k. \n\nSo, considering that, adding \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" might improve stability. Also, the recommended shrinkage is 0.35, which is already in \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\". However, the current candidates might not have the l2 parameter set. The \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" is a weighted method, not ridge stacking. \n\nSo, adding \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" could be beneficial. Also, checking the valid_candidate_names, \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" is present. Therefore, adding that candidate might improve robustness. \n\nAdditionally, the current candidates include \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", which is a selection method. The recommended top_k is 5, which is already used. However, the stability might be improved by adding other methods. \n\nSo, the plan is to add \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" to the current candidates, as it aligns with the recommended l2 and top_k parameters, potentially improving stability. Also, since the current \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" is unstable, adding another method with similar parameters but different approach might help. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to only add names from valid_candidate_names. \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" is in the valid list. Therefore, adding that would be allowed. Also, the rationale would be to improve stability by adding a ridge stacking method with the recommended l2 and top_k. \n\nSo, the JSON response would include adding \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" and keeping the existing candidates. No removals are needed since the current candidates are using the recommended parameters. The params_overrides would be empty since the method isn't changed. The rationale is applying the recommended knobs for stability with few windows.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [\"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"remove_names\": [], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"rationale\": \"Recommended knobs applied with trim_ratio=0.2, top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0 for stability with n_windows=3.\", \"changes\": [\"Added ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 to align with recommended l2=50.0 and top_k=5 for improved robustness.\"], \"when_good\": \"Robust\"}"
