      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate names from the provided library and set parameters. First, I need to check the validation summary and recommended candidates.\n\nLooking at the validation_summary, there are 26 models with varying RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID values. The best models per horizon include ARIMA, CWT_catboost, NaiveMovingAverage, etc. The disagreement is high, with a relative spread mean of 0.5685. The recommended_knobs suggest candidates like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_single_by_validation, and others.\n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options. The user wants at least 3 candidates. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, topk_mean_per_horizon_k8, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim0.8, and poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.8.\n\nI should select a mix of baseline, selection, and weighted methods. The score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. The rationale should mention the high disagreement and the selection of diverse methods to handle it. Also, need to ensure that any top_k parameters are set based on the validation_summary and recommended_knobs. For example, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 uses top_k=5, which is in the recommended parameters. Similarly, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5. So, I'll select these along with baseline_mean for robustness.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for robustness, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for leveraging top models, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for weighted aggregation.
