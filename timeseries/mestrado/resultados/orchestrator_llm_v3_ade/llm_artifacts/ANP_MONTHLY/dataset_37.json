      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate names from the provided library and set parameters. First, I need to check the validation summary and recommended candidates.\n\nLooking at the validation_summary, there are 3 windows, 26 models, and the best models per horizon vary. The disagreement is high, with a relative spread mean of 0.44. The recommended_knobs suggest candidates like baseline_mean, robust_median, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others.\n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options. The user's example used topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 with top_k=7. But in the recommended_candidates, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is present with top_k=5. Since the validation has 3 windows, maybe a lower top_k is better to avoid instability. The example used top_k=7, but here, the recommended is 5. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is in the recommended list.\n\nI should select at least 3 candidates. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then, maybe the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is in the recommended_candidates. But the user's example had two candidates. However, the instructions say to prefer at least 3. Let me check the recommended_candidates again.\n\nThe recommended_candidates list includes baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, topk_mean_per_horizon_k8, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim0.8, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.8. \n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and maybe ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example had two. However, the user's instruction says to prefer at least 3. Let me check the parameters. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which is in the params. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 has l2=50 and top_k=5. \n\nSo, selected_names could be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example only had two. However, the user's instruction says to prefer at least 3. Let me check the score_preset. The example used \"balanced\". The score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, robust_smape. Since the validation has high disagreement, maybe balanced is a good choice. \n\nSo, the final selection would be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But need to make sure the params_overrides are set correctly. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which is already in the params, so no override needed. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35, which is also in the params. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 has l2=50 and top_k=5. So, no overrides needed. \n\nBut the user's example had two candidates. However, the instruction says to prefer at least 3. So, maybe include three. Let's go with baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. That's three. The rationale would be based on the validation_summary and recommended_knobs, selecting top_k=5 for stability with few windows and shrinkage.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for stability with few windows, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 to leverage weighted aggregation with shrinkage.
