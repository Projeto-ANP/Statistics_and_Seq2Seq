      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others. \n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I should focus on the ones recommended. The user mentioned to select at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there's baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0.\n\nI need to make sure I only use names from the candidate_library. The example shows that top_k should be set explicitly if needed. For instance, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5. The validation_summary's disagreement has a relative spread mean of ~0.19, which isn't too high, but there are some variations. \n\nSince the user wants a balanced approach, maybe selecting a mix of baseline, selection, and weighted methods. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation (a selection method), and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 (a weighted method). Also, ridge_stacking is another option. \n\nI should check if the params_overrides are needed. For example, if a candidate requires top_k, I need to set it. The recommended_candidates have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=5, which is already set. So maybe no overrides needed here. \n\nThe score_preset can be \"balanced\" as per the example. The rationale should explain the selection. So, selecting baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, maybe include ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 for diversity. But the example only had three, so maybe stick to three. \n\nWait, the example had three candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended_candidates list includes baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, etc. So choosing three from these. \n\nI think the best approach is to pick baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. These cover different strategies: baseline, selection, and weighted. Also, the rationale would be that they provide a balanced approach considering different methods. \n\nI need to make sure that the JSON is correctly formatted with selected_names, params_overrides (if any), score_preset, force_debate, debate_margin, and rationale. Since the example didn't have params_overrides for those selected, maybe it's not needed here. \n\nSo the final JSON would have selected_names as [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], score_preset as \"balanced\", and the rationale explaining the selection.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, per-horizon selection for adaptability, and inverse-RMSE weighting to leverage model-specific strengths while mitigating overfitting through shrinkage.\"}"
