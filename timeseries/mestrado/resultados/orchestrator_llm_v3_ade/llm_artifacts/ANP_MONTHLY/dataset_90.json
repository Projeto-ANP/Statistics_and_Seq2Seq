      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others. \n\nI need to select candidate names from the candidate_library. The example given in the rules uses candidates like \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\". Looking at the recommended_candidates, there's a \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" which are suggested. Also, \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" and \"exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0\" are in the recommended list.\n\nThe user mentioned to prefer at least 3 candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates list again. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, topk_mean_per_horizon_k8, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0.\n\nI should pick a few of these. The example in the rules used topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Maybe include those, plus another one like ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Also, the score_preset can be \"balanced\" as per the example. The rationale would be based on the validation_summary and recommended_knobs. Since the user mentioned to set top_k explicitly if needed, I need to check if any of the selected candidates require top_k. For example, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which is already set. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5 as well. So maybe no need to override unless there's a recommendation to adjust it. The recommended_knobs suggest using top_k=5, so I can stick with that.\n\nSo the selected_names could be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Wait, but the example had two candidates. The user said to prefer at least 3. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. There's also best_per_horizon_by_validation. Maybe include that as well. But the example had two. Hmm. The user said \"prefer returning at least 3 candidates.\" So maybe select three. Let's go with baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But that's four. Alternatively, maybe three. Let me check the example again. The example had two, but the user says to prefer at least three. So perhaps three. Let me pick baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, the score_preset is \"balanced\" as per the example. The rationale would be that these candidates are recommended and balance between different approaches.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected top-performing combination strategies from recommended candidates: baseline_mean for simplicity, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for robust aggregation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for adaptive weighting based on validation performance.\"}"
