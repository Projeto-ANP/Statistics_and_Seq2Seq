    "raw": {
      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some forecasting strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and others with inverse RMSE weights and ridge stacking.\n\nLooking at the candidate_library, there are a lot of options. The user's instructions say to select at least 3 candidates, using names from the library. The example shows using topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 with specific top_k values. \n\nIn the recommended_candidates, there's a topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is recommended. The score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. \n\nSince the validation has some disagreement (relative_spread_mean is 0.18), maybe a balanced approach is good. The example uses topk_mean with k=5 and inverse RMSE with k=5. The recommended_candidates also include these. \n\nI should select three candidates. Let's pick baseline_mean as a safe option, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, maybe include ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 as a stacking method. But the example only had two, but the user said at least three. Wait, the example had two but the user said prefer at least three. \n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, there are more options. Let me check the recommended_candidates list again. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, topk_mean_per_horizon_k8, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0. \n\nSo, I can choose three from these. Maybe topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Also, the score_preset could be balanced as per the example. The rationale would be based on the validation_summary and recommended_knobs. Need to make sure to set top_k if needed. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 already has top_k=5 in its params, so no override needed. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 also has top_k=5. So, the selected_names would be those three. Then, set the score_preset to balanced and rationale explaining the choice based on the validation and recommended candidates.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for leveraging top-performing models, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for weighted aggregation based on validation performance.

      "skeptic": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to act as an auditor to check if any strategies are using y_true from the same window being evaluated. But first, I need to process the tool response provided.\n\nLooking at the tool response, there's a debate packet with validation summaries, candidate rankings, and some parameters. The current candidates are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The task is to determine if any of these candidates might be using y_true from the same window they're evaluated on, which would be a leak.\n\nFirst, I need to check the types of these candidates. The baseline_mean is a simple average, so it's probably safe. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is a weighted average using inverse RMSE weights. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 selects the top 5 models per horizon. \n\nWait, the problem is about leakage, so if any of these methods use data from the same window they're predicting, that's bad. The tool's response doesn't mention any specific leakage issues, but I need to ensure that the candidates aren't using y_true from the same window. \n\nLooking at the parameters, the eval_config uses expanding window mode with train_window 5. The candidates like inverse_rmse_weights might use historical RMSE values to weight models, which could be from previous windows, not the same one. The topk_mean_per_horizon selects models based on past performance, which should be from previous windows. The baseline_mean is just an average, so no leakage there.\n\nThe recommended knobs suggest shrinkage of 0.35 and top_k of 5, which are parameters that might affect how weights are applied but not directly use y_true from the same window. The allowed edits include parameters like shrinkage and trim_ratio, which are hyperparameters, not data leakage points.\n\nSince the tool's response doesn't indicate any candidates using y_true from the same window, and the methods described (weighted averages, top-k selection) typically use historical data, there's no evidence of leakage. Therefore, no changes are needed. The rationale would be that the current candidates don't use y_true from the same window, so the strategy is valid.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [], \"remove_names\": [], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"rationale\": \"No evidence of y_true leakage in current candidates.

      "statistician": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to build a debate packet tool first, then return a JSON with specific keys. The current candidate names are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The valid candidate names include various other models like ade_dynamic_error, exp_weighted_average, inverse_rmse_weights with different parameters, etc.\n\nLooking at the tool response, the validation summary shows that n_windows is 3, which is small. The recommended knobs suggest using stronger regularization/shrinkage because of the few windows. The recommended top_k is 5, shrinkage 0.35, l2 50.0, and trim_ratio 0.1. \n\nThe current candidates include inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, which already has shrinkage 0.35, matching the recommended knob. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k 5, which also aligns with the recommendation. However, the baseline_mean is a baseline model, and maybe with the small n_windows, adding more robust models could help.\n\nThe stability flags for the best candidate (inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35) show that it's not unstable. But since n_windows is small, maybe adding other models with higher shrinkage or different parameters could improve robustness. However, the user's instructions say to prefer stability when n_windows is small and follow recommended_knobs. The current candidates already align with the recommended top_k and shrinkage. \n\nLooking at the allowed edits, we can add or remove candidates. The recommended_knobs suggest top_k 5, which is already in the current candidates. The shrinkage is 0.35, which is also present. The trim_ratio in the recommended is 0.1, but the current candidates don't have that. However, the current candidates might not have trim_ratio parameters. Wait, the current candidates are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The inverse_rmse_weights has shrinkage, but trim_ratio isn't mentioned here. The valid_candidate_names include models with trim_ratio, like trimmed_mean_r0.10, but those aren't in the current candidates. \n\nBut the user's allowed edits say can_add_candidates is true. However, the recommended_knobs mention trim_ratio 0.1. Maybe adding a trimmed_mean model with trim_ratio 0.1 would be beneficial. But the current candidates don't have that. However, the user's instruction says to only use names from valid_candidate_names. Looking at valid_candidate_names, there's trimmed_mean_r0.10, which is a valid name. So maybe adding that could help. But the current candidates don't have it. However, the user's current_candidate_names are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The allowed edits allow adding candidates. \n\nBut the recommended_knobs don't mention adding new candidates, just adjusting parameters. Since the current candidates already have the recommended top_k and shrinkage, maybe no changes are needed. However, the tool's recommended_knobs mention trim_ratio 0.1. The current candidates don't have trim_ratio parameters. But the existing candidates might not have that. However, the user's instruction says to prefer stability when n_windows is small. The current candidates might already be stable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is already using shrinkage 0.35, which is part of the recommended knobs. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 uses top_k 5. The baseline_mean is a baseline. Since the recommended knobs are applied, maybe the rationale is \"Recommended knobs applied\" and no changes are needed. The user's instruction says if uncertain, return that. \n\nLooking at the per_horizon_winners, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is the winner in most metrics. The stability flags for the best candidate show it's not unstable. Therefore, maybe no changes are needed. The JSON should have add_names and remove_names as empty, params_overrides as empty, rationale as \"Recommended knobs applied\", changes as empty, and when_good as \"Robust\".\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [], \"remove_names\": [], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"rationale\": \"Recommended knobs applied\", \"changes\": [], \"when_good\": \"Robust\"}"
