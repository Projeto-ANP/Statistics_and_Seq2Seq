      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and others with inverse RMSE weights and ridge stacking.\n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I need to select those that are recommended. The user mentioned to prefer at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates section, there's baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, and others. \n\nI should check the parameters. For example, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has a top_k of 5, which is already set. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 also has top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 uses l2=50 and top_k=5. \n\nThe score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the user didn't specify, maybe default to balanced. Also, the example shows using top_k explicitly if needed. Since the recommended candidates already have top_k set, maybe no overrides are needed unless there's a reason to adjust. \n\nWait, the user said to set top_k explicitly via params_overrides for any candidate whose params include top_k. The recommended_candidates have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=5, so maybe that's already set. But if there's a need to adjust, but the example shows that if the validation_summary suggests a different top_k, we should set it. However, in this case, the recommended_knobs already have top_k=5, so maybe no override is needed. \n\nSo, selecting the recommended candidates: baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example shows at least 3, so maybe pick three. The user might prefer a mix of selection and weighted methods. \n\nLooking at the rationale, the example used topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 with top_k=7, but here the recommended is top_k=5. Since the validation_summary's recommended_knobs have top_k=5, maybe stick with that. \n\nSo, selected_names could be baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example had three, so maybe three is enough. However, the user said to prefer at least three. Let me check the recommended_candidates list again. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0. \n\nBut the user wants to select from the candidate_library. The example in the tools shows that the selected_names must be from the candidate_library. The recommended_candidates are part of the candidate_library. So, I can select those. \n\nI think the best approach is to select three candidates: baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, maybe include ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example had three, so maybe three is sufficient. \n\nThe score_preset is balanced by default. The rationale would be that these candidates are recommended and cover different approaches (baseline, top-k mean, inverse RMSE weights). Also, since there's some disagreement in the validation_summary, using a combination of methods might be better. \n\nI need to make sure that the selected names are in the candidate_library. The candidate_library includes all the recommended_candidates. So, the selected_names should be from there. \n\nSo, the final selection would be baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example had three, so maybe pick three. Let me check the example again. The example had two candidates with top_k set. But the user said to prefer at least three. \n\nAlternatively, maybe select three: baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. That's three. The rationale would be that they are recommended and cover different strategies. The score_preset is balanced. No need for force_debate unless the scores are very close, but the example didn't use it. \n\nSo, the JSON would have selected_names as those three, params_overrides if needed. Since topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which is already in the params, no override needed. Same for inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. So, params_overrides is empty. Score_preset is balanced. Rationale is that they are recommended and cover different approaches.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected recommended candidates covering baseline, top-k averaging, and inverse-RMSE weighting strategies for robustness\"}"
