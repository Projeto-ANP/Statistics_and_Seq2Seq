      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among the models. The recommended_knobs suggest candidates like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_single, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, and inverse_rmse_weights. Also, there's a ridge_stacking and some exponential and polynomial weighted averages.\n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I need to pick those that are in the recommended_candidates. The user mentioned to select at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there's baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, topk_mean_per_horizon_k8, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim0.8, and poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.8.\n\nI should consider the validation_summary's disagreement and the number of windows. Since there are only 3 windows, methods that are too complex might be unstable. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 seem reasonable. Also, the baseline_mean is a safe choice. Maybe include the robust_median as well for robustness. The ridge_stacking might be too unstable with few windows, so perhaps skip that. The exp and poly weighted averages could be good but need to check if they're in the recommended list. Yes, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim0.8 and poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.8 are in the recommended_candidates.\n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim0.8, and poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.8. Wait, but the user said at least 3. Let me check the top_k parameters. The recommended_knobs have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=5. The validation_summary's meta says top_k=5. So I should set top_k explicitly. Also, the score_preset could be balanced as per the example. The rationale would be based on the validation_summary and recommended_knobs.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim0.8\", \"poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.8\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim0.8\": {\"trim_ratio\": 0.8}, \"poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.8\": {\"trim_ratio\": 0.8}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected top-k mean, inverse RMSE weights, and polynomial/exponential weighted averages based on validation summary and recommended knobs.
