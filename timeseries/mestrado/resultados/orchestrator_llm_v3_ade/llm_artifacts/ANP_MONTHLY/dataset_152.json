      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate names from the provided library and set parameters. First, I need to check the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make informed choices.\n\nLooking at the validation_summary, there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best_per_horizon has some models like ONLY_DWT_catboost, DWT_rf, THETA, etc. The disagreement metrics show a relative spread mean of around 0.042, which isn't too high, but there's some variation.\n\nIn the recommended_candidates, there are several options. The baseline_mean is a safe choice, but maybe combining it with others. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are suggested. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is there. \n\nThe user's example used topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 with top_k set to 7. But in the recommended_knobs, the top_k is 5. However, the validation_summary's best_per_horizon has a top_k of 5. Wait, the recommended_candidates include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. \n\nI should select at least 3 candidates. Let's pick baseline_mean for stability, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, maybe include the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example had two, so maybe three is better. \n\nCheck if the params_overrides are needed. For the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, the top_k is already 5, so no override. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k 5 and shrinkage 0.35, which matches the recommended. So no overrides needed. \n\nScore_preset: The user's example used \"balanced\". Since the validation has a mix of metrics, balanced makes sense. Force_debate is false unless there's high disagreement, but the relative spread isn't extremely high. So, set to false. \n\nRationale: Chose baseline_mean for stability, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for averaging top models, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for weighted averaging with shrinkage. All are recommended and fit the data's structure.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for stability, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to leverage top-performing models, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for adaptive weighting.
