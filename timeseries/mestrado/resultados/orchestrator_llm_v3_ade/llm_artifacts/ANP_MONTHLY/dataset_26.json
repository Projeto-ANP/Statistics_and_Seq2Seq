      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed decision.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, indicating some heterogeneity. The disagreement metrics are high, so maybe strategies that handle model disagreement well would be good. The recommended_candidates include several options like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_single, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, inverse_rmse_weights, ridge_stacking, exp_weighted_average, and poly_weighted_average.\n\nSince the user mentioned high disagreement, maybe selecting a method that averages top models or uses weights based on performance could be effective. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are recommended. Also, the score_preset is set to \"balanced\" by default, but maybe adjusting based on the metrics could help. However, the user might prefer a balanced approach unless specified otherwise.\n\nI should check the recommended_candidates list. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are there. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is recommended. These seem like solid choices. Including a baseline like baseline_mean as a conservative option might be good too. The example given in the instructions used three candidates, so I should aim for at least three.\n\nWait, the user's example included \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" with top_k set to 7, but in the current recommended_candidates, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5. The validation_summary's best_per_horizon shows that some models perform better in specific horizons, so using a top_k of 5 might be appropriate here. Also, the shrinkage parameter in inverse_rmse_weights is set to 0.35 as per the recommended_knobs.\n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean as a baseline, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, maybe include the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 for a more sophisticated approach. However, the user might want at least three candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The example in the tool response includes three candidates, so I'll go with that. The score_preset is balanced, which is the default. The rationale would be that these candidates balance between simplicity and leveraging model performance.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, top-k mean to leverage top-performing models, and inverse-RMSE weights to dynamically adjust model contributions based on validation performance.\"}"
