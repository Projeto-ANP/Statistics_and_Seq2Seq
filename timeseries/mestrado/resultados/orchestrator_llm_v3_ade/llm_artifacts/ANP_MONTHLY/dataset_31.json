      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed choice.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best_per_horizon has some unique winners, and the disagreement metrics indicate high disagreement. The recommended_candidates include several options like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, and various weighted methods.\n\nSince the user mentioned high disagreement, maybe a method that combines multiple models would be better. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are recommended. Also, the score_preset could be balanced as it's a common choice when there's a mix of metrics.\n\nI should check the params_overrides. For example, if I choose topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, I need to set top_k explicitly. The recommended_knobs suggest top_k=5, so that's probably safe. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has shrinkage 0.35, which is already in the params.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not inventing any candidates. The selected names must be from the candidate_library. Looking at the recommended_candidates, \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" are present. Also, \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\" is another option.\n\nThe user wants at least 3 candidates. Let me pick three: baseline_mean for simplicity, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for combining top models, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for weighted averaging. The score_preset as balanced makes sense here. No need for force_debate since the selection is based on the validation data.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, topk_mean for robust aggregation, and inverse_rmse_weights for adaptive weighting based on validation performance\"}"
