      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and others with inverse RMSE weights and ridge stacking.\n\nLooking at the candidate_library, there are a lot of options. The user's instructions say to select at least 3 candidates, prefer using top_k based on validation_summary and recommended_knobs. The example shows using topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k set to 7, but in the validation_summary, the recommended top_k is 5. Wait, the recommended_knobs have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and k8. The meta in recommended_knobs says top_k is 5. So maybe I should use that.\n\nThe score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. The user didn't specify a preset, so maybe default to balanced. Also, the example uses \"Conservative selection\" if unsure, but I should check the recommended candidates.\n\nIn the recommended_candidates, there's baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, topk_mean_per_horizon_k8, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0.\n\nSo, selecting three candidates from these. Maybe baseline_mean as a safe choice, then topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 (since it's recommended with top_k=5), and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, check if they need top_k overrides. The params_overrides should set top_k for any candidate that requires it. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5 in the params, so maybe no override needed. But the example had explicit top_k, so perhaps set it explicitly here.\n\nWait, the candidate_library's inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5 in its params. So in params_overrides, if I select that candidate, do I need to set top_k? The rules say to set top_k explicitly if the params include it. Since the candidate's params have top_k=5, I should include that in params_overrides. But the example had topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=7, but here the recommended is 5. So maybe just use the default.\n\nAlternatively, the validation_summary's recommended_knobs has top_k=5. So for topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, the top_k is already 5, so no need to override. But the example had an override. Hmm, maybe the user wants to ensure that top_k is set based on the validation_summary. Since the recommended_knobs have top_k=5, I should use that.\n\nSo selected_names could be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Then set score_preset to balanced. The rationale would be that these candidates are recommended and balance between simplicity and weighted approaches.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected top-performing baseline and weighted combination strategies with validated top_k=5 parameters\"}"
