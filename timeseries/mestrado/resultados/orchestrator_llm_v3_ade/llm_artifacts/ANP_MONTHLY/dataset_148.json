      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate names from the provided library and set parameters. First, I need to look at the validation summary and recommended candidates.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 3 windows, 26 models, and a horizon of 12. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, etc.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select at least 3 candidates, prefer using the recommended ones. The example shows selecting candidates with explicit top_k parameters. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there's \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" which both have top_k=5. Also, \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" uses top_k=5. The validation_summary's meta mentions top_k=5 as a parameter. \n\nI should check if the top_k is set correctly. The recommended_candidates have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=5, which matches the meta's top_k=5. So, I can use that. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 also uses top_k=5. \n\nThe score_preset could be \"balanced\" as per the example. The rationale should mention selecting based on validation_summary and recommended_knobs. Need to make sure not to include any candidates not in the library. \n\nSo, the selected_names would be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and maybe ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example only had two, but the user said to prefer at least 3. Let me check the recommended_candidates list again. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, topk_mean_per_horizon_k8, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0. \n\nSo, selecting three from these. Maybe baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example had two, but the user said at least three. Let me pick three. Also, check if the top_k is set. For example, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which is already in the params. So no need to override. But if there's a need to adjust, but the example shows overriding. Wait, the user said to set top_k explicitly if needed. Since the recommended_candidates already have top_k=5, maybe no override is needed. \n\nSo the final selection would be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and maybe another one like ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example only had two. However, the user said to prefer at least three. Let me check the output_schema example. The example had two, but the user instruction says to prefer at least three. So I need to select three. Let me pick baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the output schema example only had two. Maybe the user allows three. \n\nWait, the user's example had two, but the instruction says to prefer at least three. So I should select three. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, topk_mean_per_horizon_k8, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0. \n\nSo, selecting three: baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, maybe include ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example had two. However, the user's instruction says to prefer at least three. So I'll go with three. The score_preset is \"balanced\" as per the example. The rationale would be selecting based on validation_summary and recommended_knobs, using top_k=5 as recommended.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected top-performing candidates from recommended list: baseline_mean for robustness, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for diversified averaging, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for adaptive weighting.
