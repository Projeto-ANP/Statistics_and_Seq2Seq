      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others. \n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I should stick to the ones in the recommended_candidates. The user mentioned selecting at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there's baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0.\n\nI need to choose a few of these. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is recommended with top_k=5. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 also uses top_k=5. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 uses top_k=5 as well. The score_preset could be \"balanced\" as per the example. \n\nWait, the user said to prefer returning at least 3 candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The example includes baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Maybe those are good choices. Also, the ridge_stacking might be another one. But I need to make sure that the top_k is set properly. The validation_summary's recommended_knobs have top_k=5, so I should set that in params_overrides if needed.\n\nLooking at the params for inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, it already has top_k=5, so maybe no override is needed. However, the example in the instructions shows that sometimes top_k is set explicitly. But in this case, since the candidate's params already include top_k=5, maybe it's okay. \n\nSo, selected_names could be baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the user said to prefer at least 3. Let me pick three. Maybe baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, the score_preset is \"balanced\" as per the example. The rationale would be that these candidates balance between simplicity and weighted aggregation, leveraging both top models and inverse RMSE weighting.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for robustness, top-k mean for horizon-specific aggregation, and inverse-RMSE weights to leverage model performance differences.
