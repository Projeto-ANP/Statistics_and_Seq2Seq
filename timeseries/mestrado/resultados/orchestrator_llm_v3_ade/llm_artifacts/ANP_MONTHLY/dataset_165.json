      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others. \n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I should focus on the ones recommended. The user mentioned selecting at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there's baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0.\n\nI need to choose candidates that are in the recommended list. The example given used topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 with top_k set to 7. But in the validation_summary, the top_k for the recommended candidates is 5. Wait, the user's example had top_k 7, but here the recommended top_k is 5. So maybe I should use top_k 5 for those candidates.\n\nAlso, the score_preset can be set. The user's example used \"balanced\". The score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the user didn't specify, maybe \"balanced\" is a safe choice.\n\nI need to make sure that any candidate that requires top_k has it set explicitly. For example, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which is already in the params. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 also has top_k=5. So maybe those are okay as is. But if there's a need to adjust, but the example had overrides. However, the user's example had top_k 7, but here the recommended is 5. So perhaps no override is needed here.\n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and maybe ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example had 3 candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates list again. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, etc.\n\nThe user's example had three candidates. So maybe pick three from the recommended list. Let's go with baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, check if they are in the candidate_library. Yes, they are. \n\nThe rationale should explain the selection. Since the validation has some disagreement, using a combination of baseline, topk mean, and inverse RMSE weights might balance different aspects. The score_preset is balanced. No need for force_debate unless there's a close call, but with the given data, maybe not. So the final JSON would include these three candidates with the balanced preset.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for robustness, top-k mean for diversity, and inverse RMSE weights for adaptive weighting based on validation performance\"}"
