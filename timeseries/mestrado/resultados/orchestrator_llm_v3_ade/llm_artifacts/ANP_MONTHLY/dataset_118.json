      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate names from the provided library and set parameters. First, I need to check the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed choice.\n\nLooking at the validation_summary, there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best_per_horizon shows that different models win at different horizons, which suggests that a method that adapts per horizon might be good. The disagreement metrics have a mean relative spread of around 6%, which isn't too high, but there's some variation.\n\nIn the recommended_candidates, there are several options. The baseline_mean is a simple average, which is stable but might not leverage model-specific strengths. The best_per_horizon_by_validation selects the best model for each horizon, which could be effective given the varying winners. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and k8 average the top models, which might balance performance and stability. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 uses weights based on RMSE with shrinkage, which could handle model variability. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 uses ridge regression, which might be good for combining models. The exp_weighted_average and poly_weighted_average are other weighting methods, and ade_dynamic_error is a dynamic approach.\n\nConsidering the number of windows is only 3, methods that require more data might be unstable. The topk methods with k=5 or 8 could be a good middle ground. The inverse_rmse_weights with shrinkage might prevent overfitting. Also, the recommended_candidates include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Since the user prefers at least 3 candidates, I should pick a few from these.\n\nI need to ensure that any candidate requiring top_k has that parameter set. The recommended_knobs suggest top_k=5, so I'll use that. The score_preset could be balanced as it's a general approach. The rationale should explain the selection based on validation and recommended strategies.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected per-horizon best model selection, top-5 mean aggregation, and inverse-RMSE weighting with shrinkage based on validation performance and recommended strategies\"}",
      "skeptic": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to act as an auditor to evaluate the current candidates in the debate packet. The current candidates are \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", and \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\". The tool response provided detailed evaluation results, so I need to analyze these to decide if any changes are needed.\n\nFirst, looking at the candidate rankings. The top candidates in the universe include \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", and \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\". The scores for these are close: the score margin between the top two is 0.00068, which is very small. This suggests that they are all performing similarly, but maybe there's a need to check their stability.\n\nLooking at the stability metrics. For \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", the RMSE_std is 7693.03, and the stability flag says \"unstable\" with rmse_std_over_rmse at 0.44. That's a high standard deviation relative to the RMSE, indicating instability. The other candidates might have similar issues. For example, \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" has RMSE_std of 7769.27, which is also high. \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\" has RMSE_std of 7619.71, which is slightly lower but still high. \n\nThe recommended knobs suggest using a shrinkage of 0.35 and trim_ratio of 0.1, but the current candidates might not be following these. However, the user's current candidates include \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" which already uses shrinkage 0.35. Maybe that's why it's in the top. But since it's marked as unstable, perhaps we should consider other candidates from the universe that might have better stability.\n\nLooking at the universe's top candidates, there's \"poly_weighted_average_p0.5_trim0.6\" with a lower RMSE of 16921.27 and a stability RMSE_std of 8452.54. Wait, but that's higher than the current candidates. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k12_sh0.70\" has RMSE 16833.18 and RMSE_std 8424.97. Still, the current candidates have lower RMSE but higher standard deviation. \n\nThe problem is that the current candidates are unstable. The tool's recommended knobs mention \"few_windows => stronger regularization/shrinkage\", which might mean that the current shrinkage is not enough. However, the current \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" already uses shrinkage 0.35. Maybe increasing it further could help, but the user can't change the method. \n\nSince the allowed edits include adding or removing candidates, perhaps we should consider adding more stable candidates from the universe. For example, \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k12\" has a lower RMSE in the leaderboard. But the user's current candidates are \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", so maybe switching to k=12? However, the user's allowed edits can add candidates, so adding \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k12\" might be an option. But the current candidate is k5, which is already in the list. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the \"allowed_edits\", the user can add candidates from the valid_candidate_names. The valid_candidate_names include \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k10\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k12\", etc. Since the current candidate is k5, maybe adding k10 or k12 could provide better stability. However, the user's current candidates are already using k5, and the tool's recommended knobs suggest top_k=5, so maybe that's optimal. \n\nAnother angle: the current candidates are all in the top of the universe, but they are unstable. The tool's \"best\" candidate is \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", but it's marked as unstable. The rationale says \"few_windows => stronger regularization/shrinkage\", but the current shrinkage is 0.35. Maybe increasing it to 0.5 or higher? However, the allowed edits don't mention changing shrinkage parameters beyond the current ones. Wait, the allowed_edits include \"shrinkage\" as a parameter that can be adjusted. But the user's current candidate is already using shrinkage 0.35. The recommended knob says \"few_windows => stronger regularization/shrinkage\", so maybe increasing shrinkage would help. However, the user can't change the method, but can adjust parameters. Wait, the allowed_edits include \"params_allowed\" with shrinkage, so maybe the user can adjust the shrinkage parameter. But the current candidate is \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", which already has shrinkage 0.35. If the user can adjust that, maybe increasing it to 0.5 would help. However, the tool's response doesn't mention changing parameters, only adding/removing candidates. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says that the auditor can only add or remove candidates, not change parameters. The allowed_edits include \"params_allowed\" but the user can't change them unless specified. The original problem says that the auditor can't change params.method, but can adjust other parameters. However, the user's current setup might not have those parameters set optimally. But according to the rules, the auditor can't change params.method, but can adjust other parameters. However, the user's current candidates are already using certain parameters. \n\nGiven that the current candidates are unstable, perhaps the best approach is to add more stable candidates from the universe. For example, looking at the universe's leaderboards, \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k12\" has a lower RMSE than the current candidates. Adding that might improve stability. However, the current candidate is \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", so adding k12 could be a good idea. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the \"inverse_rmse_weights_k12_sh0.70\" which has a lower RMSE and similar stability. But the user's current candidate is \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", so adding \"inverse_rmse_weights_k12_sh0.70\" might be better. However, the user can only add candidates from the valid_candidate_names. \n\nBut the user's current candidates are already in the list. The auditor's job is to decide whether to add or remove based on the evaluation. Since the current candidates are unstable, maybe removing them and adding more stable ones. However, the tool's response says that the current candidates are in the top, but they are unstable. \n\nThe rationale for the best candidate is that it's unstable, so maybe removing it and adding others. However, the user's current candidates include \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", which has a stability flag of \"stable\"? Wait, looking back: the \"best\" candidate's stability_flags says \"unstable\": true. The other candidates' stability isn't explicitly mentioned, but their RMSE_std is also high. \n\nIn this case, since the current candidates are unstable, the auditor might recommend removing them and adding more stable ones. However, the allowed_edits say \"can_add_candidates\" and \"can_remove_candidates\" are true. So, perhaps removing the current candidates and adding ones with better stability. \n\nLooking at the universe's top candidates, \"poly_weighted_average_p0.5_trim0.6\" has a lower RMSE but higher RMSE_std. Not sure. Alternatively, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k12_sh0.70\" has RMSE 16833.18 and RMSE_std 8424.97. Still, the standard deviation is high. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the \"stability_flags\" for the best candidate, it's marked as unstable. The user's current candidates might all be unstable. Therefore, the auditor might recommend removing them and adding candidates that are more stable. However, the tool's response doesn't explicitly list other stable candidates. \n\nAlternatively, since the current candidates are the top performers but unstable, the auditor might suggest keeping them but noting the instability. However, the user's instruction is to reject or rewrite any strategy that uses y_true from the same window being evaluated. Wait, the initial instruction says that the auditor must reject strategies that use y_true from the same window. But the current candidates are part of the evaluation, so maybe they are using y_true from the same window. However, the tool's response doesn't mention that. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to check if the current candidates are the best and if they are stable. Since they are unstable, the auditor might recommend adding more stable candidates. However, without explicit information on other stable candidates, it's hard to say. \n\nAlternatively, since the current candidates are the top performers but unstable, the auditor might not recommend any changes, as they are the best available. But the tool's response says that the best candidate is unstable, so maybe the auditor should remove it and add others. However, the allowed_edits allow adding candidates. \n\nIn the end, the auditor might decide to remove the unstable \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" and add a more stable candidate like \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k12\" from the universe. But I need to check if that's allowed. The valid_candidate_names include \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k12\", so adding that is possible. However, the current candidate is \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", so adding k12 could be a good idea. \n\nBut the tool's response doesn't provide enough information on the stability of other candidates. Therefore, the auditor might not have enough evidence to make changes and decide to keep the current candidates, noting their instability. However, the user's instruction says to reject strategies that use y_true from the same window. Since the current candidates are part of the evaluation, maybe they are using y_true from the same window, which is not allowed. But the tool's response doesn't mention that. \n\nThis is confusing. Given the information, the auditor might not have enough data to make changes and thus return \"No changes\" with a rationale that the current candidates are the best but unstable. However, the user's instruction says to reject any strategy that uses y_true from the same window. If the current candidates are using y_true from the same window, they should be removed. But the tool's response doesn't mention that. \n\nAlternatively, the auditor might not find any issues with the current candidates and thus return no changes. But the instability is a concern. However, without knowing which candidates are stable, it's hard to proceed. \n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided data, the current candidates are the top performers but unstable. The auditor might recommend removing them and adding more stable ones, but without explicit information on other stable candidates, it's uncertain. Therefore, the safest choice is to return no changes, noting the instability but lacking evidence for better alternatives.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k12\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k12_sh0.70\"], \"remove_names\": [\"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"rationale\": \"Current candidates show high instability (RMSE_std/RMSE > 40% for inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35).

      "statistician": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to build a debate packet tool first, then return a JSON with specific keys. The current candidate names are [\"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k12_sh0.70\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k12\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"]. The valid candidate names include various models like ade_dynamic_error, exp_weighted_average, inverse_rmse_weights, etc.\n\nLooking at the tool response, the validation summary shows that n_windows is 3, which is small. The recommended knobs suggest using stronger regularization/shrinkage because of few windows. The best candidate is inverse_rmse_weights_k12_sh0.70, but its stability flags indicate it's unstable with rmse_std_over_rmse around 0.5. The recommended knobs mention shrinkage of 0.35, trim_ratio 0.1, l2 50.0, and top_k 5.\n\nThe current candidates include inverse_rmse_weights_k12_sh0.70, which might benefit from adjusting shrinkage. However, the user can't change the method, so I can't replace it. The recommended knobs suggest using top_k 5, so maybe adding topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 if it's not already there. Wait, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is already in current_candidate_names. But the tool's universe has other candidates like inverse_rmse_weights with different shrinkage values. For example, inverse_rmse_weights_k12_sh0.35 might be a better choice with shrinkage 0.35 as recommended.\n\nThe rationale says to prefer stability when n_windows is small. The current inverse_rmse_weights_k12_sh0.70 has a high shrinkage (0.70), which might be too much. The recommended shrinkage is 0.35, so maybe replacing it with a candidate that has shrinkage 0.35. Looking at valid_candidate_names, there's inverse_rmse_weights_k12_sh0.35. So, perhaps removing inverse_rmse_weights_k12_sh0.70 and adding inverse_rmse_weights_k12_sh0.35. Also, check if other candidates with recommended parameters exist.\n\nAdditionally, the recommended top_k is 5, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is already in current_candidate_names. So maybe keeping that. The trim_ratio is 0.1, so looking for candidates with trim_ratio 0.1. However, the current candidates don't have trim_ratio parameters. The existing candidates are inverse_rmse_weights with shrinkage, not trim_ratio. Maybe the trim_ratio is part of other models, but the current candidates don't include them. So perhaps focusing on shrinkage and top_k.\n\nAlso, the l2 parameter is recommended as 50.0, which relates to ridge_stacking_l250_topk3 or similar. But the current candidates don't include ridge_stacking. However, the user can only add or remove from current_candidate_names. Since the current candidates don't have those, maybe not applicable here.\n\nSo, the main action would be to replace inverse_rmse_weights_k12_sh0.70 with a candidate that has shrinkage 0.35, like inverse_rmse_weights_k12_sh0.35. Also, check if that candidate is in valid_candidate_names. Yes, inverse_rmse_weights_k12_sh0.35 is present. Therefore, remove the current inverse_rmse_weights_k12_sh0.70 and add inverse_rmse_weights_k12_sh0.35. Also, ensure that the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is kept as it's part of the recommended top_k=5.\n\nThe rationale would be applying the recommended knobs for stability with few windows. The changes would be replacing the shrinkage parameter in the inverse_rmse_weights candidate. However, since the user can't change parameters directly, they have to replace the candidate with one that has the recommended shrinkage. Therefore, adding the new candidate and removing the old one.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [\"inverse_rmse_weights_k12_sh0.35\"], \"remove_names\": [\"inverse_rmse_weights_k12_sh0.70\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"rationale\": \"Applied recommended knobs for few windows: reduced shrinkage from 0.70→0.35 to improve stability\", \"changes\": [\"Replaced inverse_rmse_weights_k12_sh0.70 with inverse_rmse_weights_k12_sh0.35\"], \"when_good\": \"Robust with n_windows=3\"}"
