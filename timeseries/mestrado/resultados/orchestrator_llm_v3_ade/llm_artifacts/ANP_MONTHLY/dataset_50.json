      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some forecasting strategies based on the provided validation summary and candidate library. First, I need to make sure I understand the data given.\n\nLooking at the validation_summary, there are 26 models and 3 windows with a horizon of 12. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs suggest candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and others with inverse RMSE weights and ridge stacking.\n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, including various trimmed means, top-k means, inverse RMSE weighted averages, and stacking methods. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names from the candidate_library and set params_overrides if needed. They also mention preferring at least 3 candidates and setting top_k based on validation_summary and recommended_knobs. If unsure, default to baseline_mean with a balanced score_preset.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are suggested. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is there. These seem like good candidates because they are recommended and have parameters that might be effective given the number of models and windows.\n\nI need to check if these names are present in the candidate_library. Yes, they are. For the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, the top_k is already set to 5, which matches the recommended_knobs. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 also has the correct parameters. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is also in the library with the right parameters.\n\nSo, selecting these three candidates: baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Wait, the example shows three candidates, but the user said to prefer at least three. However, the output schema example has selected_names with baseline_mean and another. Maybe include three here.\n\nWait, the recommended_candidates list includes baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. So maybe pick three from these. The user might want a mix of baseline, selection, and weighted methods.\n\nAlso, the score_preset should be balanced as per the example. The rationale would be that these candidates are recommended and cover different approaches. Need to make sure that the params_overrides are set correctly. For example, if any candidate requires top_k, ensure it's set. But in the recommended_candidates, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 already has top_k=5, so no need to override. Similarly for others.\n\nSo the final selection would be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example only had three. Maybe three is sufficient. Let me check the instructions again: \"prefer returning at least 3 candidates.\" So three is okay.\n\nThus, selected_names would be [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], with score_preset as \"balanced\" and rationale explaining the selection based on recommendations.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline, top-k mean, and inverse-RMSE weighted candidates based on validation performance and recommended strategies\"}"
