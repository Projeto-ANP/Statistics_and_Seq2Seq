      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate names from the provided library and set the score_preset. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed choice.\n\nLooking at the validation_summary, there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best_per_horizon shows that models like DWT_rf, THETA, and others are top performers in different horizons. The disagreement metrics have a mean of around 0.204, which isn't extremely high, but there's some variation.\n\nIn the recommended_candidates, there are several options. The baseline_mean is a safe choice, but maybe more aggressive strategies could be better. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are suggested. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is there. \n\nConsidering the number of models (26) and windows (3), using a top-k approach with k=5 might be reasonable to balance diversity and performance. The inverse_rmse_weights with shrinkage could help in cases where some models have lower RMSE. The ridge stacking might be more complex but could capture interactions between models.\n\nI should select at least three candidates. Maybe baseline_mean for stability, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for a selection method, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for weighted averaging. Also, the ridge_stacking could be a good addition. However, the user example shows three candidates, so maybe pick three. The score_preset is balanced as per the example. Need to check if top_k is set properly. The recommended_knobs suggest top_k=5, so that's okay. The rationale would be based on the validation results and the need for a balanced approach.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, top-k mean for diversity, and inverse-RMSE weights with shrinkage for adaptive weighting.
