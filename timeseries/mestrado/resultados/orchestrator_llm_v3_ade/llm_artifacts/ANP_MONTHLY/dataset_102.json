      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed choice.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best_per_horizon has some models winning in different horizons, but there's a lot of disagreement, as indicated by the relative_spread_mean of 0.35. The recommended_candidates include several options like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, and various weighted methods.\n\nSince the user mentioned high disagreement, maybe a robust method would be better. The baseline_mean is a safe choice, but the trimmed_mean might handle outliers better. However, the recommended_candidates also suggest topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. \n\nLooking at the score_presets, \"balanced\" is a good default. The user might prefer a combination of methods that balance different metrics. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are both in the recommended list. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is another option for stacking.\n\nI should select at least three candidates. Maybe include baseline_mean for simplicity, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for handling top models, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for weighted averaging. Check if their parameters are correctly set. The top_k for topk_mean is 5, which matches the recommended. The inverse_rmse_weights has top_k 5 and shrinkage 0.35 as per the recommended. \n\nAlso, ensure that the selected names are in the candidate_library. Yes, they are present. The score_preset is set to \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. No need for force_debate unless the scores are very close, but with the given data, it's probably safe to proceed without it.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, topk_mean for robustness against disagreement, and inverse_rmse_weights for adaptive weighting.

      "skeptic": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to act as an auditor to evaluate the current candidates and possibly suggest changes. The current candidates are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The tool response has a lot of data, so I need to parse through it carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the candidate rankings. The top candidates are inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and baseline_mean. The scores are close, with inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 having a slightly higher score than the others. However, the stability flags mention that inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is unstable, with a high RMSE standard deviation. That's a red flag because instability might mean it's not reliable across different windows.\n\nThe recommended knobs suggest using a shrinkage of 0.35 and a trim ratio of 0.2. The current candidate inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has a shrinkage of 0.35, which matches the recommendation. But the trim ratio here isn't mentioned, so maybe that's not an issue. However, the stability issue remains.\n\nLooking at the per-horizon winners, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 wins in some metrics but baseline_mean and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 also have wins. The score margin between the top two is small (about 0.008), so there's not a huge difference. However, the instability of inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 might make it a candidate for removal.\n\nThe allowed edits say we can remove candidates. Since inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is unstable, maybe removing it would be better. The rationale would be that despite its slightly higher score, its instability could lead to worse performance in some windows. Also, the recommended knobs might suggest parameters that could be adjusted, but since the user can't change the method, only add or remove candidates.\n\nSo, the plan is to remove inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and keep the others. But wait, the current_candidate_names include it, so removing it would be allowed. The other candidates, baseline_mean and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, are stable. Also, the tool's universe includes other candidates like topk_mean_per_horizon_k3, but since the user can only add from the valid_candidate_names, maybe adding a similar topk candidate with a different k? But the current ones are k5 and k3. However, the user's current list doesn't have k3, but the allowed edits say can add candidates. However, the user's instruction says to only use names from valid_candidate_names. The valid_candidate_names include topk_mean_per_horizon_k3, so maybe adding that could be an option. But the current candidates are k5 and k3 is not in the current list. However, the user's current_candidate_names are [\"baseline_mean\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], so adding topk_mean_per_horizon_k3 would be allowed. But the tool's recommended knobs suggest top_k=5, so maybe keeping k5 is better. However, the user might want to consider other topk candidates. But the problem is that the user's current setup has inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 which is unstable. So, removing that and adding a more stable candidate. But the tool's universe has other candidates like ridge_stacking_l2100_topk3, but the user can only add from valid_candidate_names. Wait, the valid_candidate_names include ridge_stacking_l2100_topk3, but the current_candidate_names don't have it. However, the user can add it if it's in the valid list. But the user's instruction says to only add from the tool-provided universe. So, maybe adding ridge_stacking_l2100_topk3 could be an option. However, the current candidates are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The tool's universe includes ridge_stacking_l2100_topk3, which is a valid candidate. But the user might not want to add too many. Alternatively, since the current top candidates are inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and the latter is stable, maybe keeping topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and baseline_mean, and removing the unstable one. Also, the recommended knobs suggest top_k=5, which aligns with the current topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. So, the best action is to remove the unstable inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and keep the others. That would make the candidate list more stable. The rationale would be that the removed candidate has high instability, and the remaining ones are more stable. Also, the score difference is small, so removing the unstable one is better for reliability.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k3\"], \"remove_names\": [\"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"top_k\": 3}, \"rationale\": \"Removed unstable inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 (high RMSE_std/POCID_std).

      "statistician": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to build a debate packet using the provided tool and then return a JSON with specific keys. The current candidates are baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k3, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The tool response has a lot of data, including validation summaries, candidate rankings, and recommended knobs.\n\nFirst, I need to check the recommended knobs. The recommended_knobs section says \"few_windows => stronger regularization/shrinkage\" with top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.2. Since the current candidates are topk_mean_per_horizon_k3 and k5, maybe adjusting the top_k to 5 is already part of the current setup. However, the recommended top_k is 5, which is already in the current candidates as topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. So maybe that's already included.\n\nLooking at the candidate_ranking_top, both topk_mean_per_horizon_k3 and k5 have the same score. The baseline_mean has a slightly lower score. The stability flags for the best candidate (topk_mean_per_horizon_k5) show that it's unstable with rmse_std_over_rmse around 0.469. The recommended knobs suggest stronger regularization, which might mean adding candidates with shrinkage or trim_ratio parameters.\n\nLooking at the valid_candidate_names, there are several candidates with trim ratios and shrinkage parameters. For example, inverse_rmse_weights_k..._sh... and others. Also, there are ridge_stacking_l2..._topk... which involve l2 regularization. The recommended knobs mention l2=50.0, so maybe adding ridge_stacking_l250_topk3 or similar.\n\nBut the current candidates don't include any of these. The allowed_edits say can_add_candidates is true. So perhaps adding candidates that incorporate the recommended knobs. For example, adding ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 (since top_k is recommended as 5) and maybe some inverse_rmse_weights with shrinkage 0.35. However, the valid_candidate_names have entries like inverse_rmse_weights_k10_sh0.35, etc. But the recommended shrinkage is 0.35, so maybe adding those.\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names are baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k3, and k5. The tool's recommended_knobs suggest using top_k=5, which is already in the current candidates. However, the stability is an issue. The recommended knobs also mention trim_ratio=0.2, so maybe adding trimmed_mean_r0.20. Also, the shrinkage parameter is 0.35, so adding inverse_rmse_weights with sh=0.35.\n\nLooking at the valid_candidate_names, there's trimmed_mean_r0.20, which matches the trim_ratio recommendation. Also, inverse_rmse_weights_k..._sh0.35. For example, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. But the current candidates don't have these. So adding those might improve stability.\n\nHowever, the user's instructions say that I can only add candidates from valid_candidate_names. So I need to check which ones are there. The valid_candidate_names include trimmed_mean_r0.20, which is a trimmed mean with 20% trim ratio. Also, inverse_rmse_weights with various k and sh values. For example, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35.\n\nSo, adding trimmed_mean_r0.20 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 might be good. Also, the recommended l2 is 50.0, so adding ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the current candidates have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, which is a selection method, not ridge stacking. However, the allowed_edits say can_add_candidates is true, so adding ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 would be allowed.\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names are baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k3, and k5. The tool's recommended_knobs suggest using l2=50.0, so adding ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Also, adding trimmed_mean_r0.20 for trim_ratio=0.2 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for shrinkage=0.35.\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names don't have these. So the add_names would be those candidates. However, the user's allowed_edits say can_add_candidates is true, so that's allowed.\n\nBut wait, the user's current_candidate_names are [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k3\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"]. The valid_candidate_names include \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", and \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\". So adding those would be valid.\n\nHowever, the user's instructions say that if uncertain, return the default JSON with rationale \"Recommended knobs applied\". But since the recommended knobs suggest adding candidates with specific parameters, maybe it's better to add those.\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names already have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, which is a selection method. The recommended top_k is 5, which is already in the current candidates. However, the stability is an issue. The recommended knobs also suggest stronger regularization, so adding ridge_stacking with l2=50.0 and trim_ratio=0.2, and inverse_rmse_weights with shrinkage=0.35.\n\nSo, the add_names would be \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\", and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\". However, the user's allowed_edits say can_add_candidates is true, so that's allowed.\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names don't have these, so adding them would be appropriate. However, the user's current_candidate_names have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, which is a selection method. The ridge_stacking is a different method, but the user's allowed_edits say can_add_candidates is true, so that's allowed.\n\nBut the user's instructions say that I must only use candidate names from valid_candidate_names. The valid_candidate_names include \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\", and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\".\n\nSo, adding those would be appropriate. However, the user's current_candidate_names don't have them, so adding them would be allowed.\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names are baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k3, and k5. The tool's recommended_knobs suggest using l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.2, shrinkage=0.35. So adding the corresponding candidates.\n\nTherefore, the add_names would be \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\", and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\". However, the user's allowed_edits say can_add_candidates is true, so that's allowed.\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names don't have these, so adding them would be appropriate. However, the user's instructions say that if uncertain, return the default JSON. But since the recommended knobs are provided, it's better to apply them.\n\nSo, the final JSON would include adding those candidates, and the rationale would be \"Recommended knobs applied: top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.2 for stability with few windows.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [\"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"remove_names\": [], \"params_overrides\": {\"top_k\": 5, \"trim_ratio\": 0.2, \"shrinkage\": 0.35, \"l2\": 50.0}, \"rationale\": \"Recommended knobs applied: top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.2 for stability with few windows (n_windows=3).
