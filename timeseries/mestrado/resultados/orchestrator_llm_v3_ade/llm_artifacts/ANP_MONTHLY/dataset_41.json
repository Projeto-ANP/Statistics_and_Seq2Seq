      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate names from the provided library and set parameters. First, I need to look at the validation summary and recommended candidates.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there's high disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of 0.347. The best models per horizon vary, and there are 5 unique winners. The recommended candidates include baseline methods like mean and median, trimmed mean, selection methods like best_single and topk_mean, and weighted methods like inverse_rmse_weights and ridge stacking.\n\nSince there's high disagreement, maybe a robust method would be better. The trimmed_mean_r0.20 is a baseline that's robust to outliers. Also, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and k8 are recommended. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is a weighted method that might handle the disagreement by giving more weight to better models. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is another option for combining models with regularization.\n\nI should select a few candidates. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is recommended. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is also a good candidate. Maybe include the ridge_stacking as well. But wait, the user said to prefer at least 3 candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates list again. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_single, best_per_horizon, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, topk_mean_per_horizon_k8, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim0.8, and poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.8.\n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the user wants at least 3. Let me check if the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is in the candidate_library. Yes, it's there. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is present. The ridge_stacking is also available. \n\nFor the score_preset, since there's high disagreement, maybe \"balanced\" is a good choice. The rationale would be that these candidates balance robustness and model combination, handling the high disagreement and leveraging top models.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected robust baseline, top-k averaging for stability, inverse-RMSE weighting for adaptive model emphasis, and ridge stacking for regularization.
