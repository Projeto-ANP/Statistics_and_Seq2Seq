      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some forecasting strategies based on the provided tool response. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The models have varying RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID values. The best_per_horizon indicates that different models win in different horizons, which suggests high disagreement among models. The disagreement metrics have a relative spread mean of around 0.62, which is quite high, so the models don't agree much. \n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, there are several options. The baseline_mean and robust_median are simple baselines. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and k8 are selection methods that take top models per horizon. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and others are weighted methods. There's also ridge_stacking and some dynamic error weighting methods.\n\nSince the models have high disagreement, maybe using a method that combines multiple models would be better. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 seems reasonable, but the recommended_candidates also include inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is a stacking method which might handle the disagreement better.\n\nThe score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the user didn't specify a preset, maybe balanced is a safe choice. However, the validation_summary's best_per_horizon shows that some models perform better in specific horizons, so maybe a method that adapts per horizon is better.\n\nI need to select at least three candidates. Let's check the recommended_candidates list. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are both in the recommended list. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is there. These three could be good candidates. \n\nWait, the user's example shows selecting candidates with explicit top_k. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5, which matches the recommended_knobs. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 also uses top_k=5. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 uses top_k=5 as well. So these three are all using top_k=5, which might be appropriate given the validation_summary's meta info where top_k is 5.\n\nSo, the selected_names would be topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. The params_overrides would set top_k to 5 for each, but since they already have top_k=5 in their params, maybe no overrides are needed. Wait, looking at the candidate_library, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5, so no need to override. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 also has top_k=5. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 has top_k=5. So params_overrides can be empty.\n\nThe score_preset could be \"balanced\" as a default. The rationale would be that these methods handle high disagreement by combining top models or using weights, which is suitable given the high relative spread.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected methods that handle high model disagreement through ensemble averaging (topk_mean), inverse-RMSE weighting with shrinkage, and ridge stacking.
