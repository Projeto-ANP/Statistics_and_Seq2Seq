      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed choice.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, indicating that the models' performance isn't consistent across all horizons. The disagreement metrics have a mean relative spread of around 0.14, which isn't extremely high, but there's some variation. The recommended_knobs suggest candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the top ones include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. These seem to be the most promising. The user's instructions say to prefer at least 3 candidates. \n\nThe baseline_mean is a safe choice as it's a simple average, which is robust but might not capture the best performers. The best_per_horizon_by_validation selects the best model for each horizon, which could be effective given the varying performance. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 averages the top 5 models, which might balance performance and stability. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 uses weights based on RMSE with shrinkage, which could adjust for model reliability. \n\nI should check if the params_overrides are needed. For example, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has a top_k of 5, which is already set in the recommended_candidates, so no override is needed. The same applies to the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. \n\nThe score_preset is set to \"balanced\" by default, but the user might want to adjust it. However, the example shows using \"balanced\" unless specified otherwise. Since the user didn't mention a specific focus, sticking with the default makes sense. \n\nI need to ensure that the selected names are from the candidate_library. The recommended_candidates list includes these names, so that's good. Also, the rationale should explain the selection based on the validation results and recommended strategies. \n\nSo, the final selection would be baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. That's four candidates, which meets the requirement of at least three. The score_preset remains \"balanced\" as it's a general-purpose choice here.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for robustness, best_per_horizon for adaptive selection, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for balanced aggregation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for weighted ensemble based on validation performance and recommended strategies\"}"
