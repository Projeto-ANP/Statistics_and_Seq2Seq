      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some forecasting strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and others with inverse RMSE weights and ridge stacking.\n\nLooking at the candidate_library, there are a lot of options. The user wants me to select names from the candidate_library. The example given used \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" with top_k set to 7. But in the current tool output, the recommended_candidates include \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" as well. \n\nThe validation_summary's disagreement has a relative spread mean of ~0.087, which isn't extremely high, but there's some variation. The recommended_candidates suggest using topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, the baseline_mean is a safe choice. \n\nSince the user mentioned preferring at least 3 candidates, I should pick a few from the recommended list. The score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. I need to make sure to set top_k if required. The recommended_candidates have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=5, so I should use that. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is there. Maybe include the best_per_horizon_by_validation as another candidate. \n\nWait, the example in the rules used topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=7, but in the current data, the top_k is 5. So I should use the parameters as provided. Also, check if the candidates are in the candidate_library. The names like \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" are present. \n\nSo, selected_names could be [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"]. Also, set the params_overrides if needed. Since the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which is already in the params, maybe no override is needed. But the example had an override, so perhaps the user wants to adjust it. However, the recommended_knobs suggest using top_k=5, so maybe no override is necessary. \n\nThe score_preset is \"balanced\" as per the example. The rationale would be selecting these candidates based on validation and recommended strategies. So the final JSON should include these names, the preset, and the rationale.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for robustness, top-k mean for horizon-specific aggregation, and inverse-RMSE weights to leverage model performance differences\"}"
