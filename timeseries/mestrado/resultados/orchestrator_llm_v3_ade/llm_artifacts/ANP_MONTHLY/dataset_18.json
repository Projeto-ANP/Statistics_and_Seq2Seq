      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool response. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best_per_horizon has some models winning in different horizons, and the disagreement is relatively high. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, and various weighted methods.\n\nI need to select candidates from the candidate_library. The example given in the rules mentions selecting at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there are a few that stand out. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are also recommended. \n\nWait, the user's example used topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. But in the candidate_library, there's a topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is another candidate. \n\nBut the user's example had top_k set explicitly. In the validation_summary, the recommended_knobs have top_k=5. So I should check if the params_overrides need to set top_k. For example, if a candidate's params include top_k, I need to set it based on the validation_summary. \n\nLooking at the candidate_library, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which matches the recommended_knobs. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 also has top_k=5. So maybe those are already set correctly. However, the user's example had to set top_k explicitly. Wait, the rules say to set top_k using validation_summary and recommended_knobs. Since the recommended_knobs have top_k=5, maybe those candidates are okay. \n\nBut the user's example had to override top_k if needed. However, in this case, the candidates already have top_k=5, so maybe no need to override. However, the example in the rules shows that even if the candidate has top_k, you need to set it explicitly in params_overrides. Wait, the rules say: \"You MUST set top_k explicitly (via params_overrides) for any candidate whose params include top_k.\" So even if the candidate's params have top_k, I need to set it again in params_overrides. \n\nSo for the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, the params include top_k=5. So in params_overrides, I need to set {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}}. Similarly for inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. \n\nBut looking at the recommended_candidates, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is already there with top_k=5. So maybe the params_overrides would be empty? Wait, no. The rules say that even if the candidate's params include top_k, you must set it explicitly. So even if the candidate's params have top_k, you need to include it in params_overrides. \n\nSo, for example, if I select topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, I need to set top_k=5 in params_overrides. But the candidate's params already have top_k=5. So maybe that's redundant, but according to the rules, it's required. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's example had to set top_k based on the validation_summary. The validation_summary's meta has top_k=5. So the recommended top_k is 5. Therefore, for any candidate that uses top_k, we set it to 5. \n\nSo, the selected_names could be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and maybe ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example in the rules had three candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, topk_mean_per_horizon_k8, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim0.8, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.8, ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim0.8. \n\nSo, the user's example selected three candidates: baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. But the user's example had to set top_k explicitly. However, in this case, the candidate's params already have top_k=5, so maybe the params_overrides would be empty? Wait, no. The rules say that even if the candidate's params include top_k, you must set it explicitly. So even if the candidate's params have top_k=5, you need to include it in params_overrides. \n\nBut looking at the example in the rules, they set top_k=7 for the selected candidates. So in this case, the top_k is 5, so the params_overrides would be {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}. \n\nBut the user's example had to set top_k based on validation_summary. The validation_summary's meta has top_k=5, so that's correct. \n\nSo, the selected_names would be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Then, the params_overrides would set top_k=5 for those candidates. \n\nThe score_preset could be \"balanced\" as per the example. The rationale would be that these candidates are selected based on the validation_summary and recommended_knobs, using top_k=5 as recommended. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants more candidates. The rules say to prefer at least 3. So maybe include another one like ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example had three. \n\nSo, the final answer would be selecting baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, with params_overrides setting top_k=5 for each, score_preset as balanced, and rationale explaining the selection based on the validation and recommended settings.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected top-k mean and inverse-RMSE weighted strategies with shrinkage based on validation_summary and recommended_knobs, using top_k=5 as optimal for horizon heterogeneity and high disagreement.\"}"
