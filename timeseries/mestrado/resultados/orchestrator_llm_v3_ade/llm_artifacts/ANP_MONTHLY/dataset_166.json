      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some forecasting strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and others with inverse RMSE weights and ridge stacking.\n\nLooking at the candidate_library, there are a lot of options. The user's example used topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 with top_k set to 7. But in the recommended_candidates, the top_k is 5. The validation_summary's disagreement has a relative spread mean of 0.0458, which isn't extremely high, so maybe a moderate top_k is better.\n\nThe recommended_candidates include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, there's ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Since the user's example used top_k=7, but here the recommended is 5, maybe stick with 5 unless there's a reason to adjust. However, the user's instruction says to choose top_k based on validation_summary and recommended_knobs. The recommended_knobs mention top_k=5, so I should use that.\n\nSo, selecting candidates from the recommended_candidates list: baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example had 3 candidates. Maybe pick the top 3. Also, the score_preset could be \"balanced\" as per the example. Need to make sure to set the top_k parameters correctly for any candidates that require it. Since the recommended_candidates already have top_k=5, maybe no overrides are needed. But wait, the user's example had params_overrides with top_k=7. However, in this case, the recommended top_k is 5, so maybe just use that. \n\nWait, the user's example was just an example. The actual top_k should be based on the validation_summary. The recommended_knobs have top_k=5, so I should use that. Therefore, the selected_names would include baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and maybe ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the user said to prefer at least 3 candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates list again. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. So selecting three of these. Maybe the top three: baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, the score_preset is \"balanced\" as in the example. The rationale would be that these candidates balance between simplicity and leveraging model performance, using top-k averaging and inverse RMSE weighting.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected top-k mean and inverse RMSE weighted strategies with shrinkage, leveraging validated top_k=5 for stability in low-window scenarios\"}",
      "skeptic": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to act as an auditor to evaluate the current candidates in the debate packet. The current candidates are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The tool response provided has a lot of data, so I need to parse through it carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the candidate rankings. The top three candidates are baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Their scores are very close: baseline_mean has 0.636, topk_mean has 0.6398, and inverse_rmse has 0.6418. The score margin between the top two is 0.0033, which is quite small. This suggests that they are all performing similarly, but inverse_rmse is slightly better.\n\nNext, looking at the per-horizon winners. For RMSE, baseline_mean wins 6 times, topk_mean wins 4, and inverse_rmse wins 2. For SMAPE and MAPE, the counts are similar, with baseline_mean leading but inverse_rmse and topk_mean having some wins too. However, the stability metrics show that baseline_mean has a lower RMSE_std (320.32) compared to the others, which might indicate it's more stable. But the score for inverse_rmse is slightly higher, so maybe it's better overall.\n\nThe recommended knobs suggest using top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.1. The rationale is that with few windows, stronger regularization is needed. The current candidates might not be using these parameters, so maybe adjusting them could improve performance.\n\nNow, the allowed edits let me add or remove candidates. The current candidates are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The universe includes other candidates like best_per_horizon_by_validation, which might be worth considering. However, the user's instruction says not to add candidates not in the current list unless they are from the valid_candidate_names. Wait, the valid_candidate_names include \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", so maybe adding that could be an option. But the current candidates are already in the list, and the tool's recommended knobs might suggest parameters that could be applied to existing candidates.\n\nBut the user's main task is to audit and possibly adjust the current candidates. Since the current candidates are performing closely, maybe there's no need to remove any. However, the stability flags for baseline_mean show that it's unstable (rmse_std_over_rmse is 0.43, which is high). The recommended knobs suggest stronger regularization, so perhaps adjusting parameters like shrinkage or l2 could help. However, the user's rules state that I can't change params.method, only override parameters. But the current candidates might not have these parameters set optimally.\n\nWait, the allowed_edits include params_allowed: top_k, trim_ratio, shrinkage, l2. So maybe I can suggest overriding these parameters for the existing candidates. However, the user's instruction says to only use the tool-provided universe and not change params.method. The current candidates are using certain parameters, but the recommended knobs suggest different values. However, the user hasn't provided current parameter settings, so maybe I can't make that change unless it's part of the tool's response.\n\nLooking back, the tool's recommended_knobs suggest top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.1. The current candidates might be using different values. For example, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has k=5 and shrinkage=0.35, which matches the recommended. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which also matches. The baseline_mean is a baseline, so it might not have these parameters. Therefore, maybe the current candidates are already aligned with the recommended parameters, except for baseline_mean.\n\nBut the user's task is to audit the current candidates. Since the current candidates are performing closely, and the tool's best candidate is baseline_mean, but it's unstable. However, the score for inverse_rmse is slightly higher. The user's rules say to reject or rewrite any strategy that uses y_true from the same window. But I'm not sure how that applies here. Maybe the current candidates are using data from the same window, but the tool's evaluation is based on different windows.\n\nIn the end, since the current candidates are among the top performers and the score differences are small, maybe no changes are needed. However, the stability of baseline_mean is an issue. But the tool's recommended knobs might suggest adjusting parameters to improve stability. However, without knowing the current parameters, I can't make that change. Therefore, the safest option is to not make any changes, as the current candidates are performing well and the tool's rationale doesn't indicate a clear need to add or remove any.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [\"best_per_horizon_by_validation\"], \"remove_names\": [], \"params_overrides\": {\"top_k\": 5, \"shrinkage\": 0.35, \"l2\": 50.0, \"trim_ratio\": 0.1}, \"rationale\": \"Candidate 'best_per_horizon_by_validation' is in the valid universe and may improve performance.

Alternatively, maybe the existing candidates already incorporate some of these parameters.\n\nWait, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has shrinkage 0.35, which matches the recommended shrinkage.

However, the valid_candidate_names include trimmed_mean_r0.10, which is a trimmed mean with trim_ratio 0.1. But the current candidates don't have that. However, the user can add it. But the tool's response doesn't indicate that adding that would improve the results. The current top candidates are already in the list.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the existing candidates are sufficient, and the recommended knobs are already partially implemented. For example, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has shrinkage 0.35, which is the recommended value. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5. The trim_ratio is not specified here, but the recommended is 0.1. However, the existing candidates might not have that. But the user can add trimmed_mean_r0.10. However, the tool's response doesn't show that as a top candidate. The top candidates are baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and best_per_horizon_by_validation.\n\nThe stability of baseline_mean is flagged as unstable. The recommended knobs suggest stronger regularization, which might help. But the existing candidates already have some of the recommended parameters. However, the trim_ratio is not addressed. Adding a trimmed_mean_r0.10 might help with stability. But the user can only add candidates from the valid list. The valid_candidate_names include trimmed_mean_r0.10, so that's an option.\n\nBut the user's current candidates don't include that. However, the tool's response doesn't indicate that adding it would improve the results. The existing candidates are already in the top. Therefore, maybe the best approach is to keep the current candidates and apply the recommended knobs. However, the user can't change the method, only parameters. The allowed edits include changing top_k, trim_ratio, shrinkage, l2. The current candidates might not have those parameters, but the user can adjust them.\n\nWait, the current candidates are specific models. The allowed edits are parameters that can be adjusted. For example, if the user is using a model that allows changing top_k, they can set it to 5. But the current candidates are already using topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, which has top_k=5. Similarly, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has shrinkage 0.35. So the recommended knobs are already partially implemented. However, the trim_ratio is not set. The recommended trim_ratio is 0.1, but the current candidates don't have that. However, the user can't change the trim_ratio of existing candidates unless they are replaced. But the user can add new candidates that have the recommended parameters.\n\nBut the user's current candidates are the ones listed. The tool's response suggests that the best candidates are already in the current list. Therefore, maybe the best action is to keep the current candidates and apply the recommended knobs. However, the user can't change the method, only parameters. The allowed edits include changing top_k, trim_ratio, shrinkage, l2. But the current candidates are already using some of these parameters. For example, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which matches the recommended top_k. inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has shrinkage 0.35, which matches the recommended shrinkage. The trim_ratio is not specified here, but the recommended is 0.1. However, the current candidates don't have that. But the user can't change the trim_ratio of existing candidates unless they are replaced. Therefore, maybe the user should add a candidate that has trim_ratio 0.1, like trimmed_mean_r0.10.\n\nBut the tool's response doesn't show that as a top candidate. However, the recommended knobs suggest using trim_ratio 0.1. Therefore, adding trimmed_mean_r0.10 might be beneficial. However, the user can only add candidates from the valid list. The valid_candidate_names include trimmed_mean_r0.10, so that's allowed.\n\nBut the current candidates are already in the top. The user might not need to add any new candidates. Alternatively, the user might want to remove some candidates. For example, the baseline_mean is unstable. The recommended knobs suggest stronger regularization, which might help. However, the current candidates include inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, which already has shrinkage 0.35. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5. The best_per_horizon_by_validation is also in the current candidates. \n\nIn the candidate_ranking_top, the best is baseline_mean, but it's unstable. The next is topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, then inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, then best_per_horizon_by_validation. The score margins are small. The recommended knobs suggest using trim_ratio 0.1. Adding a trimmed_mean_r0.10 might help, but the user can't be sure. However, the tool's response doesn't indicate that adding that would improve the results. Therefore, maybe the best approach is to keep the current candidates and apply the recommended knobs. However, the user can't change the parameters of existing candidates unless they are replaced. Therefore, the user might need to replace baseline_mean with a more stable candidate. But the current candidates don't have that. Alternatively, the user could remove baseline_mean and add a trimmed_mean_r0.10.\n\nBut the user can only remove candidates that are in current_candidate_names. The current_candidate_names include baseline_mean. So removing it and adding trimmed_mean_r0.10 might be an option. However, the tool's response doesn't show that trimmed_mean_r0.10 is a top candidate. But the recommended knobs suggest using trim_ratio 0.1, which might be beneficial. Therefore, the user might want to add trimmed_mean_r0.10 and remove baseline_mean, which is unstable.\n\nBut the user's current candidates are baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The recommended knobs suggest using trim_ratio 0.1. The valid_candidate_names include trimmed_mean_r0.10. Therefore, adding that might be a good idea. However, the user can't be sure if it would improve the results. The tool's response doesn't provide enough information about trimmed_mean_r0.10's performance. Therefore, the safest approach is to apply the recommended knobs to the existing candidates. But the existing candidates already have some of the recommended parameters. For example, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has shrinkage 0.35. The trim_ratio is not set, but the user can't change that unless they add a new candidate.\n\nIn conclusion, the user should add trimmed_mean_r0.10 (trim_ratio 0.1) to the current candidates and remove baseline_mean, which is unstable. However, the tool's response doesn't show that trimmed_mean_r0.10 is a top candidate. But following the recommended knobs, it's better to add it. Alternatively, the user might not need to add any candidates and just apply the recommended parameters. But since the user can't change the parameters of existing candidates, they might need to replace them with ones that have the recommended parameters. However, the current candidates already have some of the recommended parameters. Therefore, the best action is to keep the current candidates and apply the recommended knobs, but since the user can't change the parameters, they might need to add new candidates that have the recommended parameters. But the tool's response doesn't provide enough info on those. Therefore, the safest answer is to apply the recommended knobs and keep the current candidates, but since the user can't change parameters, they might need to add candidates that have the recommended parameters. However, the valid_candidate_names include trimmed_mean_r0.10, which is a candidate with trim_ratio 0.1. Therefore, adding that might be beneficial.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [\"trimmed_mean_r0.10\"], \"remove_names\": [\"baseline_mean\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"top_k\": 5, \"shrinkage\": 0.35, \"trim_ratio\": 0.1, \"l2\": 50.0}, \"rationale\": \"Recommended knobs applied for few windows (n_windows=3): top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, trim_ratio=0.1, l2=50.0.
