      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided validation summary and candidate library. First, I need to make sure I only use the names from the candidate_library. The validation_summary shows that there are 3 windows, 26 models, and a horizon of 12. The models have various RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID values.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, there are several options. The baseline_mean is a simple average, which is a good starting point. Then there's best_single_by_validation, which picks the best model based on past validation. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and k8 average the top models per horizon. The inverse_rmse_weights with shrinkage and ridge stacking are more complex methods. The exp_weighted_average and poly_weighted_average are other weighted approaches. The ade_dynamic_error is another option.\n\nThe score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the user didn't specify a preset, maybe \"balanced\" is a safe default. The recommended_candidates include a mix of baseline, selection, and weighted methods. I should select at least 3 candidates. Let's pick baseline_mean for simplicity, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 as a selection method, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 as a weighted approach. Also, maybe include the best_single_by_validation. Wait, the example had three candidates. Let me check the parameters. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which is already set. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35. The recommended_candidates list includes these. So selected_names could be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, maybe include best_single_by_validation. But the example had three. Let me check the example again. The example had two candidates with top_k set. Since the user said to prefer at least 3, maybe include three. Let me confirm the names from the candidate_library. Yes, those names are present. The rationale would be choosing based on validation_summary and recommended_knobs, using top_k=5 as suggested. So the JSON would have selected_names with those three, params_overrides if needed, but since top_k is already set in the params, maybe no overrides. Score_preset as balanced. Force_debate false, debate_margin 0.02. Rationale explaining the selection.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for robustness, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for diversified averaging, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for adaptive weighting based on validation performance and recommended knobs\"}"
