      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided validation summary and candidate library. First, I need to make sure I only use the names from the candidate_library. The validation_summary shows that there's high disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of 0.3187. The recommended_knobs suggest candidates like baseline_mean, robust_median, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the top ones include baseline_mean, robust_median, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. The score_presets have options like balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the user didn't specify a preset, maybe default to balanced.\n\nI need to select at least three candidates. Let's pick baseline_mean for simplicity, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 as it's recommended, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, check if any parameters need overriding. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which matches the recommended_knobs. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 already has the shrinkage set to 0.35. So no need for overrides here. The score_preset should be balanced as it's a common choice. No force_debate needed unless there's a close call, but with the given data, it's safe to not force debate. The rationale would be selecting top candidates based on validation and recommended strategies.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, topk_mean for robust aggregation, and inverse_rmse_weights for adaptive weighting based on validation performance and recommended strategies\"}"
