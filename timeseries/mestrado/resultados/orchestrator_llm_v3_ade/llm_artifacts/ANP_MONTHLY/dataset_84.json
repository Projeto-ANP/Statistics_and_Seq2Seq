      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others. \n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I need to pick those that are in the recommended_candidates list. The user mentioned selecting at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there's baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0.\n\nI should select a few of these. The example given in the rules used topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 with top_k set to 7. But in the recommended_candidates, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5. The user's example might have a different top_k, but I need to follow the parameters from the tool's output. \n\nWait, the user's example had top_k=7, but in the tool's recommended_candidates, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5. So I should use that value. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35. \n\nThe score_preset can be \"balanced\" as per the example. The rationale should explain the selection. Since there's some disagreement in the validation_summary, maybe selecting a few robust methods like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon, and some weighted averages. \n\nI need to make sure that the selected names are from the candidate_library. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. Yes, baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0 are all in the candidate_library.\n\nSo, I'll pick three: baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, maybe include ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 for stacking. But the example had two candidates. Wait, the user said to prefer at least 3. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The example had two, but the user's instruction says to prefer at least 3. So maybe include three.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the first three are baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Then inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. So maybe select those four? But the example had two. Hmm, but the user's instruction says to prefer at least 3. Let me go with three: baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, set the top_k for topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to 5 as per the params. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 already has top_k=5. \n\nThe score_preset is \"balanced\" as per the example. The rationale would be that these candidates balance between simplicity and weighted aggregation, leveraging both top models and inverse RMSE weighting.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for ensemble diversity, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for adaptive weighting.
