      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some forecasting strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and others with inverse RMSE weights and ridge stacking.\n\nLooking at the candidate_library, there are a lot of options. The user wants me to select names from the candidate_library. The example given used \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" with top_k set to 7. But in the current tool output, the recommended_candidates include \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" as well.\n\nThe validation_summary's disagreement has a relative_spread_mean of ~0.068, which isn't extremely high, but there's some variation. The recommended_candidates suggest using topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, the baseline_mean is a safe choice.\n\nSince the user mentioned preferring at least 3 candidates, I should pick a few from the recommended list. The \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\" might be good as it selects per horizon. Also, the \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" is recommended. Maybe include \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" as well. \n\nI need to check if the params_overrides are needed. For example, if a candidate has a top_k parameter, I should set it based on the validation_summary. The recommended_knobs have top_k=5, so maybe use that. Also, the score_preset could be \"balanced\" as per the example. \n\nWait, the user's example had a top_k of 7, but in the current tool output, the recommended_candidates have top_k=5. So I should use that. Also, the \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" has shrinkage 0.35, which is already set in the params. \n\nSo the selected_names could be \"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\". But the example had two candidates. Maybe three is safer. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended_candidates list includes baseline_mean, best_single, best_per_horizon, topk_mean_k5, topk_mean_k8, inverse_rmse_k5_sh0.35, inverse_rmse_k8_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0.\n\nSo maybe pick three from these. The user's example had two, but the instruction says to prefer at least three. Let's go with \"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\". Also, include \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\" as another candidate. That makes four, but the example had two. However, the user said to prefer at least three. \n\nWait, the output schema example had selected_names with two entries. But the user instruction says to prefer at least three. So maybe include three. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended_candidates include \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", which is a selection per horizon. That might be a good candidate. Also, the \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" and \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\". \n\nSo selected_names could be [\"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"]. Also, include \"baseline_mean\" as a conservative choice. But the example didn't include it. However, the user's instruction says to select from the candidate_library. The baseline_mean is in the candidate_library. \n\nBut the example had \"baseline_mean\" as a selected name. Maybe include that as well. However, the user's example had two candidates. But the instruction says to prefer at least three. So maybe include three. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended_candidates include \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", and \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\". \n\nIncluding \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" might be a good idea as well. But the user might want to keep it simple. Alternatively, pick the top three from the recommended list. \n\nIn the end, I'll select \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" as the three candidates. The score_preset can be \"balanced\" as per the example. Also, set the top_k for the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to 5, which is already in the params. No need to override unless specified. The example had a top_k override, but in this case, the candidate's params already have top_k=5. So no need for params_overrides unless there's a change. \n\nSo the final JSON would have selected_names as those three, score_preset as \"balanced\", and rationale explaining the selection based on the validation and recommended candidates.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected top-performing strategies from validation: horizon-specific selection, top-k averaging, and inverse-RMSE weighting with shrinkage.
