      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others. \n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I should stick to the recommended ones. The user mentioned selecting at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there's baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0.\n\nI need to choose a few that are likely to perform well. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are both in the recommended list. Also, the baseline_mean is a safe choice. Maybe include the ridge_stacking as well. \n\nFor the score_preset, the balanced one is a good default. The rationale should explain why these candidates were chosen, perhaps mentioning their performance and diversity. Also, check if any parameters need overriding, like top_k for the topk_mean_per_horizon. The recommended_knobs suggest top_k=5, so I'll set that explicitly. \n\nWait, the user said to prefer returning at least 3 candidates. Let me make sure I have three. Baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. That's three. Maybe add another one like best_per_horizon_by_validation. But the example had two, so maybe three is enough. \n\nAlso, check if the params_overrides are needed. For the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, the top_k is already 5 in the params, so maybe no override. But the example had an override, so perhaps the user wants it explicit. Wait, the tool's recommended_candidates have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=5, so no need to override. \n\nSo the final selection would be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. And set the score_preset to balanced. The rationale would mention selecting these based on validation and recommended strategies.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for diversified averaging, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for adaptive weighting based on validation performance and recommended strategies.\"}"
