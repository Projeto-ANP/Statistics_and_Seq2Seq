      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others. \n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I need to select those that are in the recommended_candidates list. The user mentioned to prefer at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there's baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0.\n\nI should pick a few of these. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are both good as they use top-k models and weighted averages. Also, the ridge_stacking might be a good addition since it's a stacking method. \n\nFor the score_preset, the balanced one is probably a good default. The rationale should explain why these were chosen, maybe mentioning the diversity of methods and the validation results. Need to make sure not to include any candidates not in the library and set top_k where necessary. The tool's recommended_knobs have top_k=5 for some, so I'll use that. Also, check if any parameters need overriding, but since the user said not to change params.method, just set top_k if needed. \n\nSo, selected_names would be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. The score_preset is balanced. The rationale is that these candidates balance simplicity, ensemble methods, and stacking, leveraging the validation results.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected diverse strategies: baseline for simplicity, topk_mean for robust aggregation, inverse_rmse_weights for adaptive weighting, and ridge_stacking for regularization.
