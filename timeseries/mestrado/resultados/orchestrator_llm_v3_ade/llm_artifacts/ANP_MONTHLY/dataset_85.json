      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others. \n\nI need to select candidates from the candidate_library. The example given in the rules mentions selecting at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there are several options. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are mentioned, which are in the candidate_library. Also, the baseline_mean is a safe choice.\n\nThe score_preset can be set based on the user's needs. Since the example uses \"balanced\", maybe that's a good default. However, the user might have different priorities. But since no specific score_preset is mentioned, I'll go with the default.\n\nI should check if any parameters need overriding. For example, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has a top_k parameter. The validation_summary's recommended_knobs suggest top_k=5, so I should set that explicitly. Similarly, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35, which are already in the params.\n\nI need to make sure not to include any candidates not in the candidate_library. The recommended_candidates list includes baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others. So selecting those should be okay.\n\nAlso, the force_debate and debate_margin are set to false and 0.02 by default unless specified otherwise. Since the user didn't mention needing a debate, I'll leave those as default.\n\nPutting it all together, the selected_names would be baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. But wait, the example only had two candidates. Maybe three is better. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The example in the rules had two, but the user said to prefer at least three. So maybe include three.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, there's also ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. That could be another candidate. However, the user might not have that in their library. Wait, the candidate_library includes ridge_stacking_l250_topk5? Let me check. Yes, in the candidate_library under the stacking section. So including that as a third candidate.\n\nSo the selected_names would be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example had two, but the user said to prefer at least three. Let me confirm the candidate names in the library. Yes, those are all present.\n\nNow, the params_overrides: for topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, the top_k is 5, which is already in the params. But the user might need to set it explicitly. Wait, the rules say to set top_k explicitly if needed. Since the recommended_knobs have top_k=5, maybe it's already set, but to be safe, include it in params_overrides.\n\nSo the JSON would have selected_names with those four candidates, params_overrides with top_k for each if necessary, score_preset as balanced, and the rest as default.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected top-performing baseline, top-k averaging, inverse-RMSE weighting, and ridge stacking strategies based on validation performance and diversity of approaches\"}"
