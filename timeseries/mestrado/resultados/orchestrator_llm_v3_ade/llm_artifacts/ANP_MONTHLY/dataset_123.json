      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others. \n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I should focus on the ones recommended. The user mentioned selecting at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there's baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0.\n\nI need to choose a few that are likely to perform well. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are both in the recommended list. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is a stacking method which might be good. The baseline_mean is a safe choice as a baseline. \n\nThe score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. The rationale should explain why these candidates were selected. I need to make sure that any parameters like top_k are set explicitly. For example, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which is already in the params. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 also has top_k=5. \n\nI should check if there's a need to adjust top_k based on validation_summary. The recommended_knobs suggest top_k=5, and the validation_summary's disagreement isn't too high, so maybe keeping the default is okay. \n\nSo, the selected_names could be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. That's four candidates, which meets the requirement of at least three. The score_preset is balanced, and the rationale would mention selecting these based on the validation and recommended candidates.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for diversified averaging, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for adaptive weighting, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 for regularization-based ensemble.
