      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed choice.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, indicating high disagreement among models. The disagreement metrics have a relative spread mean of 0.55, which is moderate, but the p90 is 0.82, suggesting some horizons have high disagreement. \n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, there are several options. The baseline_mean and robust_median are simple baselines. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and k8 are selection methods that average top models. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and others are weighted methods. There's also ridge_stacking and some dynamic error weighting methods.\n\nSince the models show high disagreement, maybe a method that combines multiple models would be better. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 seems reasonable as it takes the top 5 models, which might balance out the discrepancies. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 uses weights based on RMSE, which could help in giving more weight to better-performing models. The ridge_stacking might be good too, but with only 3 windows, it might be unstable. \n\nThe score_preset is set to \"balanced\" by default. I should check if there's a better preset. The score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the user didn't specify, balanced is probably safe.\n\nI need to select at least 3 candidates. Let's pick baseline_mean for simplicity, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for combining top models, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for weighted averaging. Also, maybe include the robust_median as another baseline. Wait, the example had three candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended ones include baseline_mean, robust_median, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others. \n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, check if top_k parameters are set. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which is already in the params. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35. Since the validation_summary's recommended_knobs suggest top_k=5, that's appropriate. \n\nThe rationale should explain the selection based on high disagreement and the need for robust methods. Also, the score_preset is balanced. No need for force_debate unless the scores are very close, but with the given data, it's probably safe to not force debate.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to leverage top-performing models, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for adaptive weighting.

      "skeptic": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to act as an auditor to evaluate the current candidates in the debate packet. The current candidates are \"baseline_mean\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", and \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\". The tool response provided has a lot of data, so I need to parse through it carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the candidate rankings. The top candidates in the universe are \"best_single_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k4\", etc. But the current candidates are different. The user's current candidates are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. \n\nLooking at the candidate_ranking_top in the tool response, the top three are topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and baseline_mean. Their scores are 0.6736, 0.6785, and 0.6848 respectively. The score margin between the top two is 0.0049, which is quite small. This suggests that the current candidates are among the top performers, but maybe there's a better candidate.\n\nHowever, the allowed edits mention that we can add or remove candidates. The recommended knobs suggest using top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.2. But the current candidates don't include any of the other top candidates like \"best_single_by_validation\" or \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k4\". \n\nWait, the current_candidate_names include \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", which is in the top ranking. But \"best_single_by_validation\" is in the universe's ranking_top. However, the user's current candidates don't include that. But the user's current candidates are limited to the ones provided. The valid_candidate_names include other options, but the user's current list is only those three.\n\nThe tool's recommended knobs might suggest parameters that could be used to adjust existing candidates, but the user's current candidates are already in the top. However, the stability flags for the best candidate (topk_mean_per_horizon_k5) show that it's unstable with rmse_std_over_rmse of 0.316. This might indicate that the current candidate's performance varies a lot across windows, which could be a problem if stability is important.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to reject or rewrite any strategy that uses y_true from the same window being evaluated. Wait, the tool response doesn't mention anything about using y_true from the same window. Maybe that's not an issue here. The main task is to evaluate the current candidates and decide if any should be added or removed based on the tool's output.\n\nLooking at the per_horizon_winners, for RMSE, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 wins 6 times, baseline_mean 5 times, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 once. For SMAPE, similar. For MAPE, baseline_mean wins 7 times. However, the overall scores in the candidate_ranking_top show that topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is slightly better than inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, which is better than baseline_mean.\n\nBut the score margin between topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is very small (0.0049). So maybe there's not a strong reason to remove any current candidates. However, the baseline_mean has a higher score (0.6848) compared to the others, which might indicate it's worse. But since it's in the current candidates, maybe it's worth keeping if there's a reason.\n\nThe recommended knobs suggest parameters that could be used to adjust existing candidates. For example, the trim_ratio is recommended at 0.2, but the current candidates might not have that. However, the user's current candidates are specific instances, so maybe they can't be adjusted unless we add new ones. But the allowed edits say we can add candidates. \n\nLooking at the universe's ranking_top, \"best_single_by_validation\" has a lower score (0.6337) than the current candidates. So maybe it's not better. However, other candidates like \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k4\" have higher scores than the current ones. Wait, no, the current topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is in the universe's ranking_top as well. The universe's ranking_top includes topk_mean_per_horizon_k4, but the current candidate is k5. \n\nSo perhaps the current candidates are already among the top, but maybe there's a better candidate in the universe. However, the user's current candidates are limited to the ones they have. The allowed edits allow adding candidates from the valid_candidate_names. For example, \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k4\" is in the valid_candidate_names. But the user's current_candidate_names don't include it. However, the user's current_candidate_names include \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", which is in the top. \n\nBut the tool's recommended knobs suggest using top_k=5, which is already the case for the current candidate. So maybe there's no need to change. However, the stability of the current best candidate (topk_mean_per_horizon_k5) is marked as unstable. The rationale says \"few_windows => stronger regularization/shrinkage\", which might imply that with few windows, the model is unstable. But the user's current setup might not have enough data, leading to instability. \n\nBut the user's instruction is to act as an auditor, so maybe the conclusion is that the current candidates are acceptable, but the baseline_mean might be worse and could be removed. However, the current_candidate_names include baseline_mean, and the tool's per_horizon_winners show that it's a winner in some metrics. But the overall score is worse. \n\nAlternatively, since the score margin between the top two is small, maybe it's better to keep all current candidates. However, the user's current candidates include baseline_mean, which has a higher score than the others. But the tool's candidate_ranking_top shows that baseline_mean is third, so maybe it's not the best. \n\nIn the end, the auditor might suggest removing baseline_mean since it's the worst performer among the current candidates, and adding a better candidate like \"best_single_by_validation\" or \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k4\" if allowed. However, the allowed edits say can_add_candidates is true, so adding those might be an option. But the user's current_candidate_names don't include them. However, the valid_candidate_names include \"best_single_by_validation\", so adding that could be considered. \n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names are [\"baseline_mean\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], and the valid_candidate_names include \"best_single_by_validation\". So adding that might be a good idea. However, the tool's universe ranking shows that \"best_single_by_validation\" has a lower score than the current candidates. So maybe it's not better. \n\nAlternatively, the auditor might decide that the current candidates are acceptable, and no changes are needed. But the instability of the top candidate might be a concern. However, the user's instruction is to reject or rewrite any strategy that uses y_true from the same window, which isn't mentioned here. \n\nSo, considering all this, the auditor might suggest removing the baseline_mean since it's the worst performer among the current candidates, and keeping the other two. But the tool's per_horizon_winners show that baseline_mean wins in some metrics. However, the overall score is worse. Therefore, the recommendation might be to remove baseline_mean and add a better candidate like \"best_single_by_validation\" or another top performer. But since the score of \"best_single_by_validation\" is lower, maybe it's not better. \n\nAlternatively, the auditor might not make any changes because the current candidates are among the top, and the score differences are small. However, the instability of the top candidate might be a reason to consider adding a more stable one. But without data on stability of other candidates, it's hard to say. \n\nIn the end, based on the scores, the current candidates are top performers, but the baseline_mean is the worst. So removing it might be a good idea. The other two are in the top. So the changes would be to remove \"baseline_mean\" and keep the other two. But the tool's allowed edits say can_remove_candidates is true. So the final answer would be to remove \"baseline_mean\".\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [], \"remove_names\": [\"baseline_mean\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"rationale\": \"baseline_mean has the highest score (0.6848) among current candidates, indicating worse performance compared to topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 (0.6736) and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 (0.6785).

The tool response has a lot of data, including validation summaries, candidate rankings, and recommended knobs.\n\nFirst, I need to check the recommended knobs. The \"recommended_knobs\" section says that with few windows (n_windows is 3 here), stronger regularization/shrinkage is advised. The suggested parameters are top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.2. \n\nLooking at the current candidates, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" has shrinkage 0.35, which matches the recommended shrinkage. The top_k for the other candidate is 5, which also matches. However, the trim_ratio in the recommended is 0.2, but the current candidates don't have trim_ratio parameters. Wait, the current candidates are inverse_rmse_weights and topk_mean. The inverse_rmse_weights has a shrinkage parameter, but trim_ratio might be part of other candidates. However, the allowed edits include trim_ratio, so maybe we can adjust that.\n\nBut the user's current candidates don't include any with trim_ratio. The valid_candidate_names include things like trimmed_mean_r0.20, but those aren't in the current candidates. The allowed edits say we can add candidates. The recommended knobs suggest trim_ratio 0.2, so maybe adding a trimmed_mean candidate with trim_ratio 0.2 would be beneficial. However, the current candidates are only the two mentioned. \n\nWait, the allowed edits allow adding candidates. The valid_candidate_names include \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\", which has trim_ratio 0.2. Since the recommended knobs suggest trim_ratio 0.2, maybe adding that candidate would help. But the current candidates don't have it. However, the user's current_candidate_names are [\"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], so adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" might be a good idea. But I need to check if that's allowed. The allowed_edits say can_add_candidates is true, so yes.\n\nBut wait, the tool's recommended_knobs mention trim_ratio 0.2. However, the current candidates don't have that. So maybe adding a trimmed_mean candidate with trim_ratio 0.2 would be better. However, the current candidates are inverse_rmse_weights and topk_mean. The inverse_rmse_weights has shrinkage 0.35, which matches the recommended. The topk_mean has top_k 5, which also matches. But the trim_ratio isn't part of these candidates. The recommended knobs suggest trim_ratio 0.2, but the current candidates don't have that. So perhaps adding a trimmed_mean candidate with trim_ratio 0.2 would be beneficial. However, the user might not want to add new candidates unless necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the existing candidates are already aligned with the recommended knobs. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has shrinkage 0.35, which is the recommended. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k 5, which is the recommended. The trim_ratio isn't part of these candidates, but the recommended knobs suggest trim_ratio 0.2. However, the current candidates don't have trim_ratio parameters. So maybe the user should add a trimmed_mean candidate with trim_ratio 0.2. But the allowed_edits allow adding candidates, so that's possible.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to only use candidate names from valid_candidate_names. The valid_candidate_names include \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\", so that's allowed. However, the current_candidate_names don't include it. So adding it would be a valid action. However, the tool's response's \"best\" candidate is topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, which is already in the current candidates. The recommended knobs suggest using trim_ratio 0.2, which isn't in the current candidates. Therefore, adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" might be a good idea to incorporate the recommended trim_ratio.\n\nBut wait, the user's current candidates are inverse_rmse_weights and topk_mean. The recommended knobs suggest trim_ratio 0.2, but the current candidates don't have that. However, the allowed_edits allow adding candidates. So adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" would be appropriate. However, the user might not want to add new candidates unless they are better. The current best is topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, which is already in the current candidates. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is also in the current candidates. The recommended knobs suggest using trim_ratio 0.2, but the current candidates don't have that. However, the user might not have that candidate in their current list. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the existing candidates are already aligned with the recommended parameters. The inverse_rmse_weights has shrinkage 0.35, which matches the recommended. The topk_mean has top_k 5, which matches. The trim_ratio isn't part of these candidates, but the recommended knobs suggest trim_ratio 0.2. However, the current candidates don't have that. So perhaps the user should add a trimmed_mean candidate with trim_ratio 0.2. But the user's current candidates don't include that. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to only add candidates from valid_candidate_names. The valid_candidate_names include \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\", so that's allowed. However, the user might not want to add it unless it's better. The tool's response's \"best\" candidate is topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, which is already in the current candidates. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is also in the current candidates. The recommended knobs suggest using trim_ratio 0.2, but the current candidates don't have that. However, the user might not have that candidate in their current list. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the existing candidates are sufficient. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has shrinkage 0.35, which is the recommended. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k 5, which is the recommended. The trim_ratio isn't part of these candidates, but the recommended knobs suggest trim_ratio 0.2. However, the current candidates don't have that. But the user might not have that candidate. \n\nIn this case, the user's current candidates are already aligned with the recommended top_k and shrinkage. The trim_ratio is not part of these candidates, but the recommended knobs suggest it. However, the user might not have that candidate. Since the allowed_edits allow adding candidates, adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" would be appropriate. However, the user might not want to add new candidates unless they are better. \n\nAlternatively, the user might not need to add any candidates because the existing ones are already aligned with the recommended parameters. The trim_ratio is not part of the current candidates, but the recommended knobs suggest it. However, the user might not have that candidate. \n\nGiven the tool's recommended_knobs, the user should apply the suggested parameters. Since the current candidates have top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35, which match the recommended, but the trim_ratio is not set. However, the allowed_edits include trim_ratio, so maybe the user can adjust the trim_ratio parameter for existing candidates. Wait, the allowed_edits include \"params_allowed\" which includes trim_ratio. But the current candidates are inverse_rmse_weights and topk_mean. The inverse_rmse_weights has a shrinkage parameter, but trim_ratio is part of other candidates like trimmed_mean. \n\nWait, the allowed_edits say that params_allowed includes trim_ratio, but the current candidates don't have trim_ratio parameters. So maybe the user can't adjust trim_ratio for the existing candidates. Therefore, the only way to incorporate trim_ratio 0.2 is to add a candidate that has that parameter. \n\nTherefore, adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" would be appropriate. However, the user's current candidates don't include it. The valid_candidate_names include it, so it's allowed. \n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names are [\"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], so adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" would be a valid action.

The rationale would be that the recommended knobs suggest trim_ratio 0.2, which is not in the current candidates, so adding it would improve robustness. \n\nBut the user's current candidates are already aligned with the recommended top_k and shrinkage.
