      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed choice.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, indicating high disagreement among models. The relative spread of errors is around 0.37, which is considered high. The recommended_candidates include several options like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, and various weighted methods.\n\nSince the disagreement is high, maybe a method that combines multiple models would be better than selecting a single one. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are recommended. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is there. However, the user mentioned to prefer at least 3 candidates.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are good options. The score_preset should be balanced as per the example. Also, since there's high disagreement, maybe force_debate is needed, but the example didn't use it. Wait, the example had \"Conservative selection\" when uncertain, but here we have some candidates to choose from.\n\nI should select three candidates. Let's go with baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. The top_k for the latter is already set to 5 in the recommended_candidates, so no need to override. The score_preset is balanced. The rationale would be that these methods handle high disagreement and leverage multiple models effectively.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, top-k mean to leverage multiple models, and inverse-RMSE weights to adaptively combine performers given high model disagreement\"}"
