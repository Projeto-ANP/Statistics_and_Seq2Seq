      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate names from the provided library and set parameters. First, I need to look at the validation summary and recommended candidates.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best_per_horizon has some models like THETA, CWT_svr, NaiveMovingAverage, etc. The disagreement metrics have a mean of 0.131, which isn't too high, but there's some variation. The recommended candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates list, there are several options. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are both recommended. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is there. \n\nI should check if the parameters need overriding. For example, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has a top_k of 5, which is already set. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k 5 and shrinkage 0.35. The recommended_knobs mention that top_k is 5, so that's consistent. \n\nThe score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. The rationale should explain the selection based on the validation results and recommended candidates. I need to make sure not to include any candidates not in the library. \n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, maybe include ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 for diversity. Check if those names are in the candidate_library. Yes, they are. \n\nSet the score_preset to \"balanced\" and provide a rationale that mentions using top_k based on validation_summary and recommended_knobs. Make sure not to set force_debate unless necessary. Since the disagreement isn't extremely high, maybe not. \n\nFinal check: selected names are in the library, parameters are correctly set, and the JSON structure is valid.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 based on recommended_knobs and validation_summary's top_k=5 recommendation.

      "skeptic": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to act as an auditor to evaluate the debate packet tool's output and decide on any changes to the candidate names and parameters. The current candidates are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5.\n\nFirst, I need to check the validation summary and the candidate rankings. The best candidate according to the tool is ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 with a score of 0.6719. The next ones are topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 (0.6814), baseline_mean (0.6909), and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 (0.6988). The score margin between the top two is 0.0095, which is mentioned in the tool response.\n\nThe recommended knobs suggest using top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.1. The rationale is that with few windows, stronger regularization is better. The current candidates have parameters that might align with this, but I need to check if there are better options in the valid_candidate_names.\n\nLooking at the universe's ranking_top, there are other candidates like topk_mean_per_horizon_k8, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.6, etc. However, the current candidates are already in the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. The tool's recommended parameters might suggest adjusting trim_ratio or shrinkage, but the current candidates might already be using those values.\n\nWait, the current candidate inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has shrinkage 0.35, which matches the recommended knob. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 has l2=50.0 and top_k=5, which also aligns with the recommendations. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which is correct. The baseline_mean is a baseline, so maybe it's not adjustable.\n\nThe tool's allowed edits include changing top_k, trim_ratio, shrinkage, and l2. However, the current candidates might already be using the optimal parameters. The score of ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is the highest among the current candidates, so maybe it's the best to keep. The other candidates like topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and baseline_mean have lower scores but might be stable.\n\nThe stability flags for ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 show that it's not unstable. The recommended knobs are already reflected in the current parameters. Therefore, maybe there's no need to add or remove candidates. However, the tool's allowed edits say can_add_candidates and can_remove_candidates are true. But the current candidates are already performing well, and adding others might not be necessary. The user might want to keep the best performers.\n\nLooking at the per_horizon_winners, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 wins in some metrics, while baseline_mean and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 also have wins. However, the best overall is ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has a lower score but might be stable. However, since the tool's recommended parameters are already in use, maybe no changes are needed.\n\nThe rationale for not changing could be that the current candidates are already aligned with the recommended parameters and perform well. Therefore, the output should indicate no changes, keeping the current candidates and parameters.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [], \"remove_names\": [], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"rationale\": \"Current candidates align with recommended parameters (top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0) and show stable performance. Ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 leads in aggregate score (0.6719) with low instability (RMSE_std=25.61). No higher-performing candidates exist in the universe that are not already included.\", \"changes\": [], \"when_good\": \"Stable\"}",
      "statistician": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to build a debate packet tool first and then return a JSON with specific keys. The current candidate names are [\"baseline_mean\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"]. The valid candidate names are a longer list, so I need to make sure any additions are from that list.\n\nLooking at the tool response, the recommended knobs suggest top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.1. The rationale is because there are few windows, so stronger regularization/shrinkage is needed. \n\nThe current candidates include \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" which has l2=250, but the recommended is l2=50. However, the user says not to change params.method, so maybe that's okay. Wait, the allowed edits include l2, so maybe I should adjust that. But the current candidate is already using l2=250. Hmm, but the recommended knob is l2=50.0. However, the user instructions say not to change params.method. Wait, the allowed edits include changing l2, so maybe that's allowed. But the current candidate is \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", which has l2=250. The recommended is l2=50.0. So perhaps I should consider adding a candidate with l2=50.0 if it's in the valid list. Let me check the valid_candidate_names.\n\nLooking at valid_candidate_names, there's \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", \"ridge_stacking_l2100_topk3\", etc. But there's no \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" with l2=50. Wait, the valid_candidate_names have entries like \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", which is l2=250. The recommended knob is l2=50.0, but there's no candidate with l2=50 in the valid list. So maybe that's not possible. Therefore, perhaps the current candidate is already using l2=250, which is higher than the recommended 50. But the user says to follow recommended_knobs when available. However, since the valid_candidate_names don't have a candidate with l2=50, maybe we can't change that. \n\nThe recommended shrinkage is 0.35, and the current candidate \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" has shrinkage=0.35. So that's already matching the recommendation. The top_k is 5, which is already in the current candidates like \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\". The trim_ratio is 0.1, but the current candidates don't have trim_ratio parameters. Wait, the current candidates include \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" which has shrinkage=0.35, but trim_ratio isn't part of that. The trim_ratio is part of other candidates like \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\", but those aren't in the current candidates. \n\nThe tool's recommended_knobs suggest trim_ratio=0.1, so maybe adding a trimmed_mean candidate with trim_ratio=0.1 would be good. Looking at valid_candidate_names, there's \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\", which is trim_ratio=0.1. So adding that could be beneficial. Also, the current candidates don't have any trimmed_mean, so adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\" might improve stability.\n\nAdditionally, the current candidates have \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\". The recommended top_k is 5, which they already use. However, the stability flags for \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" show that it's stable. The \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" has shrinkage=0.35, which matches the recommendation. \n\nLooking at the candidate_ranking_top, \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" is the best with a score of 0.6718. The next is \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" with 0.6813, then \"baseline_mean\" at 0.6909, and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" at 0.6988. The score margin between top 2 is 0.0094, which is small. So maybe the current candidates are already among the top, but adding more stable ones could help.\n\nSince the recommended knobs suggest stronger regularization, maybe adding a candidate with higher l2 or trim_ratio. But the valid_candidate_names have \"ridge_stacking_l2100_topk3\" and \"ridge_stacking_l2100_topk5\", which have l2=100. However, the current candidate is l2=250. The recommended is l2=50, but since that's not available, maybe keeping the current l2 is okay. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to follow the recommended knobs even if it's not in the current candidates. But the instructions say to use the valid_candidate_names. \n\nAnother thought: the current candidates include \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" which has shrinkage=0.35, which matches the recommended shrinkage. The trim_ratio is not part of that, but the recommended is 0.1. So adding a trimmed_mean candidate with trim_ratio=0.1 could be beneficial. \n\nSo, possible actions: add \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\" from valid_candidate_names. Also, check if there are other candidates that align with the recommended knobs. The recommended top_k is 5, which is already in the current candidates. The shrinkage is already matched by \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\". The l2 is 250, but the recommended is 50. However, since there's no candidate with l2=50, maybe we can't change that. \n\nTherefore, the best action is to add \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\" to the current candidates. Also, check if any candidates should be removed. The current candidates include \"baseline_mean\", which is a baseline, but the top candidates are stacking and topk. However, the user instructions say not to remove unless specified. The tool's recommended_knobs don't suggest removing any, so maybe keep the current ones. \n\nSo, the JSON should have add_names: [\"trimmed_mean_r0.10\"], remove_names: [], params_overrides: {}, rationale: \"Recommended knobs applied with trim_ratio=0.1 for stability\", changes: [\"added trimmed_mean_r0.10\"], when_good: \"Robust\".\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [\"trimmed_mean_r0.10\"], \"remove_names\": [], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"rationale\": \"Recommended knobs applied with trim_ratio=0.1 for stability\", \"changes\": [\"added trimmed_mean_r0.10\"], \"when_good\": \"Robust\"}"
