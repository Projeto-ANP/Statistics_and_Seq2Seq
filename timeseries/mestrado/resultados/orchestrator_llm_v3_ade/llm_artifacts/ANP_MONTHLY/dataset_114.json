      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate names from the provided library and set parameters. First, I need to check the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed choice.\n\nLooking at the validation_summary, there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best_per_horizon shows that different models win at different horizons, which suggests that a method that adapts per horizon might be good. The disagreement metrics have a relative spread mean of around 0.046, which isn't extremely high, but there's some variation.\n\nIn the recommended_candidates, there are several options. The baseline_mean is a simple average, which is stable but might not leverage model-specific strengths. The best_per_horizon_by_validation selects the best model for each horizon, which could be effective given the varying winners. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and k8 average the top models, which might balance performance and stability. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 uses weights based on RMSE with shrinkage, which could handle model variability. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is a stacking method that might combine models effectively. The exp_weighted_average and poly_weighted_average are other weighting approaches. The ade_dynamic_error is a more complex method that adjusts weights based on errors.\n\nConsidering the number of windows (3) is low, methods that are too complex might overfit. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are recommended with top_k=5. Since the recommended_knobs suggest top_k=5, I should use that. Also, the shrinkage of 0.35 is mentioned in the parameters. \n\nSelecting three candidates: best_per_horizon_by_validation for its simplicity and effectiveness in varying horizons, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for its weighted approach, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for averaging top models. The score_preset could be balanced as it's a general approach. No need for force_debate since the margin is small and the candidates are diverse.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected per-horizon best model selection, inverse-RMSE weighted averaging with shrinkage, and top-5 mean aggregation based on validation performance and recommended knobs\"}",
      "skeptic": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to act as an auditor to evaluate the current candidates and decide whether to add, remove, or adjust parameters based on the provided debate packet tool results.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the current_candidate_names: [\"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"]. The tool's output shows the rankings and scores for these candidates.\n\nLooking at the candidate_ranking_top, the top three are topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and best_per_horizon_by_validation. The scores are 0.690, 0.695, and 0.713 respectively. Wait, best_per_horizon_by_validation has the highest score here. But in the per_horizon_winners, best_per_horizon_by_validation wins more often. However, the score for best_per_horizon_by_validation is 0.713, which is higher than the others. But the tool's recommended_knobs suggests top_k=5, which is already in the current candidates as topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. \n\nThe rationale says \"few_windows => stronger regularization/shrinkage\", so maybe the current candidates are already optimized. The current candidates include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 (which aligns with the recommended top_k=5), inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 (shrinkage 0.35 as recommended), and best_per_horizon_by_validation. \n\nLooking at the stability flags, the best candidate (topk_mean_per_horizon_k5) has a stability flag \"unstable\": false. The RMSE_std_over_rmse is 0.187, which might be acceptable. \n\nNow, the allowed_edits say can_add_candidates and can_remove_candidates are true. But the user's instruction says to reject or rewrite any strategy that uses y_true from the same window being evaluated. However, the tool's output doesn't mention anything about data leakage. \n\nThe current candidates are already part of the top performers. The best candidate is topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, which is already in the current list. The other candidates are also in the top. The score for best_per_horizon_by_validation is higher than the others, but it's already included. \n\nSince the current candidates are among the top performers and the tool doesn't indicate any need to add or remove based on leakage or performance, maybe there's no change needed. The rationale would be that the current candidates are performing well and align with the recommended parameters. So, the answer would be no changes, keeping the current candidates.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [], \"remove_names\": [], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"rationale\": \"Current candidates align with top-performing strategies (topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, best_per_horizon_by_validation) and recommended parameters (top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35).

      "statistician": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to build a debate packet tool first, then return a JSON with specific keys. The current candidate names are \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", and \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\". The tool response has a recommended_knobs section suggesting top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.1. The rationale is \"few_windows => stronger regularization/shrinkage\".\n\nFirst, I need to check if any candidates from the valid_candidate_names can be added. The recommended knobs mention top_k=5, which is already in the current candidates as \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\". Also, shrinkage=0.35 corresponds to \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", which is already in the current candidates. The trim_ratio=0.1 would relate to \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\" or similar, but that's not in the current candidates. However, the user's allowed_edits say can_add_candidates is true, so maybe adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\" could be considered. But the current candidates don't have it, and the tool's universe includes it.\n\nWait, but the user's current_candidate_names are [\"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"]. The recommended knobs suggest trim_ratio=0.1, which is in the valid_candidate_names as \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\". However, the current candidates don't include that. But the allowed_edits say can_add_candidates is true, so maybe adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\" would be beneficial. However, the tool's response doesn't mention that candidate in the rankings, so maybe it's not necessary. Alternatively, maybe the existing candidates are sufficient.\n\nLooking at the candidate_ranking_top, the top candidates are \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", and \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\". The recommended knobs are already reflected in the current candidates. The stability flags for \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" show that it's not unstable. The score margin between the top two is small (0.0049), so maybe there's not a strong need to add or remove candidates. However, the recommended_knobs suggest using trim_ratio=0.1, which isn't in the current candidates. But the current candidates don't have a trim_ratio parameter. Wait, the current candidates include \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" which has a top_k=5, which matches the recommended top_k. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has shrinkage=0.35, which matches the recommended shrinkage. The trim_ratio is 0.1, which would correspond to \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\", but that's not in the current candidates. However, the user's allowed_edits allow adding candidates. But the tool's response doesn't mention that candidate in the rankings, so maybe it's not necessary. Alternatively, maybe the existing candidates are sufficient.\n\nThe user's instructions say to prefer stability when n_windows is small. The validation_summary has n_windows=3, which is small. The recommended_knobs suggest stronger regularization/shrinkage. The current candidates already include the shrinkage=0.35 and top_k=5. The trim_ratio=0.1 isn't in the current candidates, but adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\" might improve stability. However, the tool's response doesn't show that candidate in the rankings, so maybe it's not needed. Alternatively, maybe the existing candidates are sufficient.\n\nThe user's allowed_edits allow adding candidates, but the tool's response doesn't indicate that adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\" would be beneficial. The current candidates are already using the recommended knobs for top_k and shrinkage. The trim_ratio isn't part of the current candidates, but since the tool's response doesn't mention it in the rankings, maybe it's not necessary. Therefore, perhaps no changes are needed, and the rationale is \"Recommended knobs applied\".\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [], \"remove_names\": [], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"rationale\": \"Recommended knobs applied\", \"changes\": [], \"when_good\": \"Robust\"}"
