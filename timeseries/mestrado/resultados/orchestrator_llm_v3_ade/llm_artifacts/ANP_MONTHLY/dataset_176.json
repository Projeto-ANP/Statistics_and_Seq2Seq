      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed choice.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, indicating some heterogeneity. The disagreement metrics have a high relative spread, so models don't agree much. The recommended_candidates include several options like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_single, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, inverse_rmse_weights, ridge_stacking, exp_weighted_average, and poly_weighted_average.\n\nSince the user mentioned high disagreement, maybe a method that combines multiple models would be better. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are recommended. Also, the score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice when there's a mix of metrics.\n\nI should select at least three candidates. Let's pick baseline_mean for simplicity, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for combining top models, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for weighted averaging. The params_overrides need to set top_k if necessary. The recommended_knobs suggest top_k=5, so that's already in the candidate names. No need to override unless specified. The rationale would mention the high disagreement and choosing robust methods.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, topk_mean for robust aggregation during high disagreement, and inverse_rmse_weights to leverage model-specific performance with shrinkage\"}"
