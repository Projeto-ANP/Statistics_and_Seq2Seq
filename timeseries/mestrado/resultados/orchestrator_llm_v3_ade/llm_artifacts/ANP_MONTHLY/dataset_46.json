      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed choice.\n\nLooking at the validation_summary, there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best_per_horizon shows that several models like DWT_svr, CWT_rf, and others are top performers in different horizons. The disagreement metrics have a mean relative spread of about 11%, which isn't extremely high, but there's some variation. The recommended_knobs suggest candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and others with inverse RMSE weights and ridge stacking.\n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I should focus on the recommended_candidates. The user's example shows selecting candidates from the recommended list. The score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the user didn't specify a preset, maybe default to balanced.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then, best_per_horizon_by_validation and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 are also good. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 are more advanced methods. Also, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0 and poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0 are there. The ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0 is another option.\n\nI need to pick at least 3 candidates. Let's go with baseline_mean for simplicity, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 as a selection method, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for weighted averaging. The rationale would be that these methods balance simplicity, selection of top models, and weighted aggregation based on RMSE. The score_preset is balanced as per the example. No need for force_debate unless there's a close call, but with the given data, it's probably safe. The top_k for the topk_mean is set to 5 as per the recommended parameters.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5, \"shrinkage\": 0.35}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for diversified aggregation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for adaptive weighting.
