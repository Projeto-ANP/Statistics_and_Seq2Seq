      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed choice.\n\nLooking at the validation_summary, there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best_per_horizon shows that different models win at different horizons, which suggests that the models have varying strengths. The disagreement metrics indicate a relative spread mean of around 10.75%, which isn't extremely high, but there's some variability. The recommended_candidates include several options like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select at least 3 candidates. The recommended_candidates list includes baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0. \n\nI should check if these names are present in the candidate_library. The candidate_library has entries for all these names. For example, \"baseline_mean\" is there, \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\" is listed, \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" exists, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" is present, \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" is in the list, and the others are also available.\n\nNow, considering the parameters. The recommended_candidates have specific params, like top_k for topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is 5, which is already set. For inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, the top_k is 5 and shrinkage is 0.35. The user's rules say to set top_k explicitly if needed. Since the recommended_candidates already have these parameters, maybe no overrides are needed unless there's a reason to adjust them. However, the validation_summary's meta mentions top_k=5, so it's consistent.\n\nThe score_preset can be chosen based on the user's preference. The example uses \"balanced\", but the user might have other options. Since the user hasn't specified, maybe \"balanced\" is a safe default.\n\nI need to ensure that the selected_names are from the candidate_library. All the recommended candidates are in the library. So, selecting baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 would be valid. However, the example output only includes three, but the user said to prefer at least three. Let me check the example again. The example had three, but the user instruction says to prefer at least three. So maybe include three or more.\n\nWait, the user's example shows three, but the instruction says \"prefer returning at least 3 candidates.\" So, I should select three or more. Let me check the recommended_candidates list again. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0. That's eight candidates. So, selecting three of them would be okay.\n\nBut the user might want a mix of different types. For example, baseline_mean (a baseline), best_per_horizon_by_validation (selection), topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 (selection), inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 (weighted), and ridge_stacking (stacking). Including a few different types could be better.\n\nHowever, the example output only includes three. Maybe the user wants three. Let me check the rules again. The rules say \"prefer returning at least 3 candidates.\" So, three is acceptable. Let's go with three: baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. But wait, the example includes \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" as two of the selected names. Maybe that's a good combination.\n\nAlternatively, the recommended_candidates list includes \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", and \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" as three candidates. Those are all in the candidate_library. Also, the score_preset can be \"balanced\" as per the example.\n\nSo, the final selection would be these three candidates. The params_overrides might not be needed if the parameters are already set in the candidate's params. For example, \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" has top_k=5, which is already in the params, so no override needed. Similarly, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" has top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35, which are already set. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 has l2=50.0 and top_k=5, which are also set.\n\nTherefore, the JSON output would include these three names, no params_overrides, score_preset as \"balanced\", force_debate as false, debate_margin 0.02, and a rationale explaining the selection based on the recommended candidates and validation summary.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline, per-horizon best model selection, and inverse-RMSE weighted averaging based on validation performance and recommended strategies\"}"
