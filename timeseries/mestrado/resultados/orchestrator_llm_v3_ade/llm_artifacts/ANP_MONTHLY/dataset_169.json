      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some forecasting strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's a high disagreement among models. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, and various weighted methods.\n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I need to pick those that are recommended. The user mentioned to select at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates section, there's baseline_mean, robust_median, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim0.8, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.8, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim0.8.\n\nI should choose a mix of baseline, selection, and weighted methods. The score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. Also, the top_k for topk_mean and inverse_rmse_weights is set to 5, which is recommended.

      "skeptic": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to act as an auditor to evaluate the debate packet tool's output and decide on any changes to the candidate names and parameters. The current candidates are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The tool's output shows the rankings and scores for these candidates.\n\nFirst, I need to check if any of the current candidates should be removed or added. The recommended knobs suggest a top_k of 5, shrinkage of 0.35, l2 of 50, and trim_ratio of 0.2. But the current candidates don't include any with trim_ratio 0.2. However, the allowed edits mention that trim_ratio can be adjusted. But the user's current candidates are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. \n\nLooking at the candidate_ranking_top, the top candidates are inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and baseline_mean. The scores are very close between the first two, with a small margin. The recommended knobs suggest that with few windows, stronger regularization/shrinkage is better. The current inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has a shrinkage of 0.35, which aligns with the recommendation. However, the trim_ratio in the recommended is 0.2, but the current candidates don't have that. But the allowed edits say trim_ratio can be adjusted. However, the user's current candidates don't include any with trim_ratio 0.2. But the allowed edits allow adding candidates from the valid_candidate_names.\n\nLooking at the valid_candidate_names, there are several candidates with trim_ratio 0.2, like trimmed_mean_r0.20, trimmed_mean_r0.25, etc. But the current candidates don't include these. However, the user's current candidates are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The tool's output shows that the best candidate is inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, but it's marked as unstable due to high RMSE_std. The stability flags indicate that the RMSE standard deviation is over 50% of the RMSE, which is a concern.\n\nThe recommended knobs suggest using a trim_ratio of 0.2, which might improve stability. However, the current candidates don't include any with trim_ratio 0.2. But the allowed edits allow adding candidates. So, perhaps adding a candidate like trimmed_mean_r0.20 or similar could be beneficial. However, the user's current candidates are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The tool's output shows that the top candidates are inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, but the stability of inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is unstable. \n\nBut the user's instructions say to reject or rewrite any strategy that uses y_true from the same window being evaluated. However, the current candidates don't seem to be using y_true from the same window. The tool's output doesn't mention any such issues. \n\nThe rationale for changes would be to improve stability. Since inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is unstable, maybe removing it and adding a more stable candidate. However, the tool's output shows that the top candidates are inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The score margin between the top two is small (0.0058). But the stability of inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is marked as unstable. \n\nSo, perhaps removing inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and adding a more stable candidate. Looking at the universe's leaderboards, trimmed_mean_r0.30 has a lower RMSE and SMAPE compared to the current candidates. However, the current candidates don't include trimmed_mean_r0.30. But the allowed edits allow adding candidates. So, adding trimmed_mean_r0.30 might be beneficial. However, the user's current candidates are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. \n\nBut the tool's output shows that the best candidate is inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, but it's unstable. The recommended knobs suggest using trim_ratio 0.2, which is not in the current candidates. However, the allowed edits allow adding candidates. So, adding a candidate like trimmed_mean_r0.20 might be better. But the user's current candidates don't have that. \n\nAlternatively, since the current candidates are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and the tool's output shows that inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is the best but unstable, maybe removing it and keeping the other two. However, the score of inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is slightly higher than topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. \n\nBut the user's instructions say to reject any strategy that uses y_true from the same window. The current candidates don't seem to be using that. Therefore, the best action might be to remove the unstable inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and add a more stable candidate from the valid_candidate_names, like trimmed_mean_r0.30. However, the allowed edits allow adding candidates. \n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names are [\"baseline_mean\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"], and the valid_candidate_names include trimmed_mean_r0.30. So, adding trimmed_mean_r0.30 could be a valid move. However, the tool's output shows that the best candidate is inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, but it's unstable. Therefore, replacing it with a more stable candidate might be better. \n\nSo, the changes would be to remove inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and add trimmed_mean_r0.30. However, the tool's output's recommended knobs suggest trim_ratio 0.2, which is not in the current candidates. But the allowed edits allow adding candidates. Therefore, adding trimmed_mean_r0.20 might be better. However, the user's current candidates don't have that. \n\nAlternatively, since the current candidates are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and the tool's output shows that inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is the best but unstable, maybe removing it and keeping the other two. However, the score of inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is slightly higher than topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. \n\nBut the user's instructions require that any strategy using y_true from the same window is rejected. The current candidates don't seem to be using that. Therefore, the best action is to remove the unstable inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and add a more stable candidate. However, the valid_candidate_names include trimmed_mean_r0.30, which has a lower RMSE and SMAPE. \n\nSo, the final decision is to remove inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and add trimmed_mean_r0.30. The rationale is that inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is unstable, and trimmed_mean_r0.30 offers better stability and performance.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [\"trimmed_mean_r0.30\"], \"remove_names\": [\"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"trim_ratio\": 0.30}, \"rationale\": \"Removed unstable inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 (high RMSE_std/POCID instability).

      "statistician": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to build a debate packet using the provided tool and then return a JSON with specific keys. The current candidates are baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and trimmed_mean_r0.30. The tool output has a recommended_knobs section suggesting top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.2. But the current candidates don't include any that use these parameters. Wait, the valid_candidate_names include things like inverse_rmse_weights with different k and shrinkage values, and trimmed_mean with different ratios.\n\nThe recommended knobs mention \"few_windows => stronger regularization/shrinkage\". The validation_summary has n_windows=3, which is small. So, following the recommended knobs, maybe I should add candidates that use higher shrinkage or trim_ratio. But the current candidates are baseline_mean (a baseline), topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 (which uses top_k=5, which matches the recommended top_k), and trimmed_mean_r0.30 (trim_ratio=0.30, but recommended is 0.20). Hmm, the trim_ratio in the current candidate is higher than recommended. Maybe that's not ideal. Also, the recommended shrinkage is 0.35, but the current candidates don't have that. \n\nLooking at the valid_candidate_names, there are candidates like inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 (shrinkage 0.35), which matches the recommended shrinkage. Also, trimmed_mean_r0.20 (trim_ratio 0.20) is in the valid list. So maybe adding those would be better. However, the user's current_candidate_names don't include these. The allowed_edits say can_add_candidates is true. So I should consider adding candidates that align with the recommended knobs.\n\nBut the user's current candidates are baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and trimmed_mean_r0.30. The recommended trim_ratio is 0.2, but the current candidate has 0.30. Maybe replacing trimmed_mean_r0.30 with trimmed_mean_r0.20? But the user might not want to remove existing candidates unless necessary. However, the rationale says to prefer stability when n_windows is small. The current trimmed_mean_r0.30 has a stability flag \"unstable\": true. So maybe replacing it with a more stable candidate.\n\nLooking at the universe's ranking_top, trimmed_mean_r0.25 has a slightly higher score than trimmed_mean_r0.30. But the recommended trim_ratio is 0.2, so maybe trimmed_mean_r0.20 is better. However, the allowed_edits can_add_candidates is true, so adding trimmed_mean_r0.20 might be a good idea. Also, adding inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 could help with shrinkage. But the user's current candidates don't have these. However, the user might not want to add too many. Alternatively, since the current trimmed_mean_r0.30 is unstable, maybe removing it and adding a more stable one.\n\nWait, the allowed_edits can_remove_candidates is true. So perhaps removing trimmed_mean_r0.30 and adding trimmed_mean_r0.20 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. But the user's current_candidate_names include trimmed_mean_r0.30. However, the tool's recommended_knobs suggest trim_ratio=0.2, so maybe replacing it. Also, the current topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 uses top_k=5, which matches the recommended top_k. So maybe keeping that. The baseline_mean is a baseline, but maybe not as good as other candidates. However, the user might have specific reasons for including it.\n\nAlternatively, since the recommended_knobs are provided, and the user's current candidates don't fully align with them, adding candidates that do would improve robustness. So adding inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 (shrinkage 0.35) and trimmed_mean_r0.20 (trim_ratio 0.2). Also, maybe adding ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 (l2=50, topk=5) as per recommended l2=50.0. But need to check if those are in valid_candidate_names. Yes, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is in the list.\n\nSo, the plan is: add candidates that align with recommended knobs (inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, trimmed_mean_r0.20, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5), and remove the unstable trimmed_mean_r0.30. But the user's current_candidate_names include trimmed_mean_r0.30. However, the allowed_edits can_remove_candidates is true, so that's allowed. Also, the rationale should mention applying recommended knobs for small n_windows. The changes would be adding the new candidates and removing the old one. But need to check if the new candidates are in valid_candidate_names. Yes, they are. So the JSON would have add_names with those three, remove_names with trimmed_mean_r0.30, and params_overrides as per the recommended knobs. Wait, but the user says not to change params.method. The params_overrides are for parameters, not the method. The current candidates are methods, so adding new methods (candidates) that use the recommended parameters. So the params_overrides might not be needed here, unless the existing candidates need parameter changes. But the user's current candidates are existing methods, so maybe the params_overrides are not applicable. Wait, the allowed_edits include params_allowed like top_k, trim_ratio, etc. But the current candidates might not have those parameters. For example, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which matches the recommended top_k=5. So maybe no need to override. However, the current trimmed_mean_r0.30 has trim_ratio=0.30, but recommended is 0.20. So maybe changing that parameter. But the user's current_candidate_names include trimmed_mean_r0.30, which is a specific candidate. To change its trim_ratio, we'd need to replace it with trimmed_mean_r0.20. So removing the current one and adding the new one. Therefore, the add_names would include trimmed_mean_r0.20, and remove_names would include trimmed_mean_r0.30. Also, adding inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But need to check if those are in valid_candidate_names. Yes, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is there, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is also in the list. So the final JSON would have add_names with those three, remove_names with trimmed_mean_r0.30, and rationale about applying recommended knobs for small n_windows. Also, when_good would be \"Robust\" as per the rules.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [\"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\"], \"remove_names\": [\"trimmed_mean_r0.30\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"rationale\": \"Recommended knobs applied for small n_windows (3) with stronger regularization/shrinkage (trim_ratio=0.2, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0).
