      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some forecasting strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library. The validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's a high disagreement among models. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, and inverse_rmse_weights.\n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I need to select those that are in the recommended_candidates list. The user mentioned to prefer at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there's baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, topk_mean_per_horizon_k8, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim0.8, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.8, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim0.8.\n\nI should pick a few that are diverse. Maybe start with baseline_mean as a simple option. Then, include a selection method like best_per_horizon_by_validation. For weighted methods, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 seems relevant. Also, the ridge_stacking could be a good stacking approach. The exp_weighted_average and poly_weighted_average are different weighting strategies. However, the user wants at least 3, so maybe select baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, check if top_k needs overriding. The recommended top_k is 5 for inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, which is already set. The score_preset could be balanced as it's a common choice. No need for force_debate unless there's a close call, but with the given data, it's probably safe. The rationale would be selecting diverse methods based on validation and recommendations.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected diverse strategies: baseline averaging, per-horizon model selection, and inverse-RMSE weighting with shrinkage, leveraging validation insights and recommended candidates.\"}"
