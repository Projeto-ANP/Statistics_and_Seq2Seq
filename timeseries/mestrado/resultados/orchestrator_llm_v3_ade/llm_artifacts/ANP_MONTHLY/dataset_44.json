      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's a high disagreement among models. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, and various weighted methods.\n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options. The user mentioned selecting at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there's baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean_0.20, best_per_horizon, topk_mean_k5, topk_mean_k8, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim0.8, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.8, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim0.8.\n\nSince the validation has high disagreement, maybe selecting a few robust methods would be good. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are also recommended. Also, the ridge_stacking might be useful here. Let me check the parameters. For topk_mean, the top_k is set to 5, which is already in the params. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has shrinkage 0.35. The score_preset could be balanced as it's a common choice. I should make sure to use the names exactly as in the candidate_library. Let me confirm the names again. Yes, \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" are present. Also, \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" is there. So selecting these three with the balanced score_preset makes sense. The rationale would be that these methods handle high disagreement and leverage multiple models effectively.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for stability, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to leverage top-performing models, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 to weight models by inverse RMSE with shrinkage, addressing high disagreement in validation.\"}"
