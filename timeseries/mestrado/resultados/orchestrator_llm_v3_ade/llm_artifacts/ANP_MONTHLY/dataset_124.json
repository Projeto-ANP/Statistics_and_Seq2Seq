      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some forecasting strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among the models. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, and various weighted methods.\n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I need to pick those that are in the recommended_candidates. The user mentioned to select at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there's baseline_mean, robust_median, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim0.8, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.8, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim0.8.\n\nI should choose a mix of baseline, selection, and weighted methods. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is recommended with top_k=5. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 uses l2=50 and top_k=5. Also, the exp_weighted_average and poly_weighted_average are there with specific parameters. \n\nBut the user wants me to set top_k explicitly if needed. The validation_summary's meta says top_k is 5. So for the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, I don't need to override since it's already set. However, for other candidates that might have different top_k, I need to check. \n\nWait, the recommended_candidates include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=5, which matches the meta's top_k=5. So no need to override. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35, which is already in the params. Similarly, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 has l2=50 and top_k=5. \n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the user said to prefer at least 3. Maybe pick three: baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, the score_preset could be balanced as per the example. The rationale would be based on the validation_summary and recommended_knobs.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, topk_mean for robust aggregation, and inverse_rmse_weights for adaptive weighting based on validation performance and recommended knobs\"}",
      "skeptic": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to act as an auditor to check the debate packet tool's output and make sure there's no leakage. The current candidates are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The tool's response has a lot of data, including rankings and scores.\n\nFirst, I need to check if any of the current candidates are using y_true from the same window they're evaluated on. The tool's output doesn't mention any specific leakage issues, but I need to ensure that the candidates' methods don't involve using future data. \n\nLooking at the candidates: baseline_mean is a simple average, so it's safe. inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 uses inverse RMSE weights with shrinkage, which should be calculated based on past data. topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 selects top models per horizon, which also shouldn't use future data. \n\nThe recommended knobs suggest parameters like shrinkage 0.35 and l2 50.0, which are within allowed ranges. The stability flags mention that the best candidate has unstable RMSE_std. However, the tool's output doesn't indicate any direct leakage. \n\nSince there's no evidence of leakage in the current candidates, and the tool's results don't show any issues, I should return that no changes are needed. The rationale would be that the current candidates are valid and there's no leakage detected.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [], \"remove_names\": [], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"rationale\": \"No evidence of y_true leakage in current candidates.

      "statistician": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to build a debate packet tool first, then return a JSON with specific keys. The current candidate names are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The valid candidate names are a long list, but I can only add or remove from the current ones or those in the valid list.\n\nLooking at the tool response, the recommended knobs suggest top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.2. The rationale is because there are few windows, so stronger regularization/shrinkage is needed. \n\nThe current candidates include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, which aligns with the recommended top_k=5. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has shrinkage 0.35, which matches the recommendation. The baseline_mean is a baseline method. \n\nThe best candidate in the ranking is topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, but its stability flags indicate it's unstable. The recommended knobs might suggest using shrinkage and trim_ratio to improve stability. However, the current candidates don't include a trim_ratio parameter. The valid candidates have entries like trimmed_mean_r0.20, which corresponds to trim_ratio=0.2. \n\nSo, maybe adding trimmed_mean_r0.20 would help with stability. Also, the recommended l2=50.0 is in the valid candidates as ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the current candidates don't have that. However, the allowed edits say can_add_candidates is true. \n\nBut wait, the user's current_candidate_names are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The tool's recommended_knobs suggest using l2=50.0 and trim_ratio=0.2. So, adding ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 (for l2=50) and trimmed_mean_r0.20 (for trim_ratio=0.2) might be beneficial. However, the user's allowed edits allow adding candidates, so I can add those. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to prefer stability when n_windows is small. The n_windows here is 3, which is small. The current candidates might not have the stability constraints. The recommended knobs suggest using trim_ratio=0.2 and l2=50.0. So adding the corresponding candidates would be good. \n\nLooking at the valid_candidate_names, there's ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 and trimmed_mean_r0.20. So, adding those would align with the recommended knobs. However, the current_candidate_names don't include them. So, the add_names should include these. \n\nBut wait, the user's current_candidate_names are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The tool's recommended_knobs suggest using l2=50.0 and trim_ratio=0.2. Therefore, adding ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 and trimmed_mean_r0.20 would be appropriate. \n\nHowever, the user's allowed_edits can_add_candidates is true, so that's allowed. Also, the rationale should mention applying the recommended knobs for stability. \n\nBut the current candidates include inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, which has shrinkage 0.35, which matches the recommended shrinkage. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which matches the recommended top_k. So maybe those are already in the current candidates. \n\nBut the stability flags for topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 are unstable. So, adding trimmed_mean_r0.20 (trim_ratio=0.2) and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 (l2=50) could improve stability. \n\nTherefore, the add_names should be trimmed_mean_r0.20 and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. The rationale would be applying the recommended knobs for stability with few windows. \n\nBut wait, the user's current_candidate_names don't have those, but the valid_candidate_names do. So adding them is allowed. \n\nSo, the JSON should have add_names as [\"trimmed_mean_r0.20\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], and the rationale is \"Recommended knobs applied for stability with few windows\". Also, the when_good would be \"Robust\" as per the rules. \n\nBut I need to check if those names are in valid_candidate_names. Yes, trimmed_mean_r0.20 is there, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is also in the list. \n\nSo, the final JSON would include those adds, and the rationale.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [\"trimmed_mean_r0.20\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"remove_names\": [], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"rationale\": \"Recommended knobs applied for stability with few windows (n_windows=3)\", \"changes\": [\"Added trim_ratio=0.2 and l2=50.0 candidates\"], \"when_good\": \"Robust\"}"
