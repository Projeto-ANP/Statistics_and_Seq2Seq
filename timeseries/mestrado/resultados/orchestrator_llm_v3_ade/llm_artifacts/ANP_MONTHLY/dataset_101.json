      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's a high disagreement among models. The recommended_knobs suggest candidates like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_single_by_validation, and others. The candidate_library has a lot of options, including various trimmed means, top-k means, inverse RMSE weights, and stacking methods.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not to invent any. Also, I need to set top_k explicitly if the candidate's params include it. The example shows selecting candidates with top_k based on validation_summary and recommended_knobs.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, there's \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\". The validation_summary's meta mentions top_k=5, so maybe using that. Also, the recommended_candidates include \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" and \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\".\n\nSince the user mentioned preferring at least 3 candidates, I should pick a few. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then, maybe the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is in the recommended list. But I need to check if those names are present in the candidate_library.\n\nLooking at the candidate_library, yes, \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" are there. Also, \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" is present. So I can select these three. The params_overrides would need to set top_k if necessary. However, the params for topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 already have top_k=5, so no override needed. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 also has top_k=5. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 has top_k=5 as well. So no need to override unless there's a different top_k. But the user's example shows setting top_k explicitly, so maybe just confirm that the top_k is set as per the validation_summary.\n\nThe score_preset can be \"balanced\" as per the example. The rationale would be that these candidates are recommended and use appropriate top_k values based on the validation data.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline and top-performing combination strategies with validated top_k=5 parameters\"}"
