      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs suggest candidates like baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and others. The candidate_library has a lot of options, including various trimmed means, inverse RMSE weights, and stacking methods.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any. Also, I need to set top_k explicitly if the candidate's params include it. The example shows using topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=7, but here the recommended_knobs have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=5. Wait, the validation_summary's recommended_knobs has topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=5, so maybe I should use that.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, there's \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\". Also, \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" is there. The score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, etc. The user might prefer a balanced approach.\n\nI need to select at least 3 candidates. Let's check the recommended_candidates list. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then, maybe the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 could be another option. But the example in the instructions used three candidates, so maybe pick those three. Also, check if their params require top_k. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5 as per the params, so no need to override unless the validation_summary suggests a different top_k. The validation_summary's meta says top_k=5, so that's probably correct.\n\nSo the selected_names would be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and maybe ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example had two, but the user said to prefer at least 3. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, topk_mean_per_horizon_k8, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0.\n\nSo maybe select baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the output schema example only had two. However, the user said to prefer at least 3. Let me check the validation_summary's meta: n_windows is 3, which is low. The recommended_candidates include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 (top_k=5), which might be appropriate. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 uses top_k=5. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 uses top_k=5. So those three plus baseline_mean. But the example had two, but the user said to prefer at least 3. So maybe select three: baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, the score_preset could be balanced as per the example. The rationale would be based on the validation_summary and recommended_knobs.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for leveraging top-performing models, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for weighted aggregation with shrinkage.
