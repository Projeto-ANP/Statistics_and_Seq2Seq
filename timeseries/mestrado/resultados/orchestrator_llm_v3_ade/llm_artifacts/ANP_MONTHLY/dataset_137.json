      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some forecasting strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_single_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and others with inverse RMSE weights and ridge stacking.\n\nLooking at the candidate_library, there are a lot of options. The user's instructions say to select at least 3 candidates, prefer using top_k based on validation_summary and recommended_knobs. The example shows selecting candidates with explicit top_k values.\n\nIn the recommended_candidates, \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" are suggested. Also, \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" is there. The validation_summary's disagreement has a relative spread mean of ~0.187, which isn't extremely high, but there are some variations. Since there are 3 windows, which is a small number, maybe using a moderate top_k like 5 is better to avoid instability.\n\nThe score_preset could be \"balanced\" as per the example. Also, the user mentioned not to invent candidates, so I need to pick from the listed ones. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 are all there. Those three seem like good choices. They cover different approaches: top-k averaging, inverse RMSE weighting, and ridge stacking. That should provide a diverse set of strategies. Also, the rationale would be that these candidates are recommended based on the validation and they use appropriate top_k values.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected top-k mean, inverse-RMSE weighted, and ridge stacking strategies based on validation performance and recommended knobs for balanced forecasting\"}"
