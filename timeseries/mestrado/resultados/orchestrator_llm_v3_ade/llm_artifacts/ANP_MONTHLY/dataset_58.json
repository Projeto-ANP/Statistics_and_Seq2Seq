      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate names from the provided library and set parameters. First, I need to check the validation summary and recommended candidates.\n\nLooking at the validation_summary, there are 26 models with 3 windows and a horizon of 12. The best_per_horizon shows that models like ONLY_CWT_catboost and ONLY_FT_svr perform well in certain horizons. The disagreement is high, with a relative spread mean of 0.79 and p90 of 2.53. That suggests models vary a lot in their performance across different horizons.\n\nThe recommended_knobs include several candidates. The top ones are baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim0.8, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.8, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim0.8.\n\nSince the user mentioned high disagreement, maybe selecting methods that aggregate models would be better. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are good candidates. Also, the ridge stacking and EWA could handle the variability. However, the recommended_candidates list includes topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. \n\nThe score_preset is set to \"balanced\" by default. The user might prefer that unless specified otherwise. Need to make sure to set top_k parameters where necessary. For example, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which is already in the params. But if there's a need to adjust, but the validation_summary's recommended_knobs suggest using top_k=5. \n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean as a baseline, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, maybe include the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 for a more sophisticated approach. But the example shows at least 3 candidates. Let me check the example again. The example had two candidates with top_k set. \n\nWait, the user's example had selected_names with two candidates, but the instruction says to prefer at least 3. So maybe include three. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim0.8, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.8, ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim0.8. \n\nSo, selecting three from these. Maybe baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, the score_preset is balanced. The rationale would be that these methods handle high disagreement and leverage multiple models effectively.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline aggregation, top-k mean for stability, and inverse-RMSE weighting to leverage model performance differences given high disagreement across horizons\"}"
