      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate names from the provided library and set parameters. First, I need to look at the validation summary and recommended candidates.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best_per_horizon has some models like FT_catboost, ETS, DWT_svr, etc. The disagreement metrics have a mean relative spread of around 0.09, which isn't too high, but there's some variation. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the top ones are baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. The score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape.\n\nSince the user mentioned horizon_heterogeneous is true, maybe a balanced approach is better. The example given used topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=7, but in the recommended candidates, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5. However, the validation_summary's recommended_knobs have top_k=5. But the user's example had top_k=7. Wait, but the tool's recommended_candidates have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=5. So maybe I should use that.\n\nWait, the user's example had topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=7, but in the current tool response, the recommended_candidates have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=5. So perhaps I need to check the validation_summary's recommended_knobs. The recommended_knobs have top_k=5. Also, the meta in recommended_candidates has top_k=5. So maybe the top_k should be 5 here.\n\nSo, selecting candidates from the recommended_candidates list. The example had three candidates, but the user's instruction says to prefer at least 3. The recommended_candidates list includes baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0.\n\nSo, I can pick baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and maybe ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example had three, so maybe three is okay. However, the user's instruction says to prefer at least 3. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended_candidates list has 9 candidates. So, selecting three from them.\n\nThe score_preset is balanced, as per the example. The rationale would be based on the validation_summary and recommended_knobs. Since the top_k is 5, and the recommended_candidates include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others. Also, the validation_summary's meta has top_k=5. So, I should set top_k=5 for any candidate that requires it.\n\nSo, the selected_names would be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Then, params_overrides would set top_k=5 for the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 (though it's already set to 5 in the params, but maybe to be explicit). However, in the tool's recommended_candidates, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, so maybe no need to override. But the user's example had top_k=7, but that's different. Wait, the user's example was an example, but in this case, the tool's recommended_candidates have top_k=5. So, perhaps the params_overrides is empty for that candidate.\n\nSo, the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  \"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"],\n  \"params_overrides\": {},\n  \"score_preset\": \"balanced\",\n  \"force_debate\": false,\n  \"debate_margin\": 0.02,\n  \"rationale\": \"Selected based on validation_summary and recommended_candidates with top_k=5 for stability and performance.\"\n}\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected top-k mean and inverse-RMSE weighted candidates with top_k=5 based on validation_summary and recommended_knobs for balanced performance across horizons.\"}"
