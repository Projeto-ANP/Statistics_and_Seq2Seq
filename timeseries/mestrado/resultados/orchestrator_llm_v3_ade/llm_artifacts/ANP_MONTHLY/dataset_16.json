      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some forecasting strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's a high disagreement among models. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, and various weighted methods.\n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I need to pick those that are recommended. The user mentioned to select at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates section, there's baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, topk_mean_per_horizon_k8, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim0.8, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.8, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim0.8.\n\nSince the validation has high disagreement, maybe using a combination of baseline methods and some weighted averages would be good. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 seem relevant. Also, the ridge_stacking might help with combining models. Let me check the parameters. The top_k for topk_mean is set to 5, which is in the recommended_knobs. For the inverse_rmse_weights, the top_k is 5 with shrinkage 0.35. The ridge_stacking uses l2=50 and top_k=5. \n\nI should make sure to include at least three candidates. Maybe baseline_mean as a safe choice, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, the score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. The rationale would be that these candidates balance robustness and performance given the high disagreement.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, topk_mean for robust aggregation, and inverse_rmse_weights for adaptive weighting given high model disagreement\"}"
