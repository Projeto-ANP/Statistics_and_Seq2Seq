      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed decision.\n\nLooking at the validation_summary, there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best_per_horizon shows that there are 8 unique winners, which suggests that no single model dominates across all horizons. The disagreement metrics have a relative spread mean of ~0.098, which isn't extremely high, but there's some variation. The recommended_candidates include several options like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select at least 3 candidates. From the recommended_candidates list, I can pick a few. The baseline_mean is a safe choice as it's a simple average. Then, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are both recommended. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 might be a good addition since it's a stacking method which could combine models effectively.\n\nI need to check if the parameters are correctly set. For example, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which is already in the params. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 has l2=50 and top_k=5. Since the user said to set top_k explicitly if needed, but in this case, the parameters are already set as per the recommended_knobs, so maybe no overrides are needed.\n\nThe score_preset should be chosen based on the focus. The balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Since the validation_summary doesn't show a clear focus on any single metric, balanced makes sense here.\n\nI should also ensure that the selected names are from the candidate_library. The recommended_candidates list includes names that are present in the candidate_library, so that's good. Finally, the rationale should explain the selection, mentioning the diversity of methods and the use of recommended candidates.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, topk_mean for diversity, inverse_rmse for adaptive weighting, and ridge_stacking for robust model combination.
