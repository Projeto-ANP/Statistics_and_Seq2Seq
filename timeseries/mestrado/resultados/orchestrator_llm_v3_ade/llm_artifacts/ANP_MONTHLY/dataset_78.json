      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate names from the provided library and set a score_preset. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed choice.\n\nLooking at the validation_summary, there are 26 models with 3 windows and a horizon of 12. The best_per_horizon shows that there are multiple unique winners, indicating high disagreement among models. The disagreement metrics have a relative spread mean of 0.65 and a p90 of 1.08, which suggests that some models perform much better than others in certain horizons. \n\nThe recommended_candidates include several options: baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_per_horizon, topk_mean with k=5 and 8, inverse_rmse_weights with k=5 and 8, ridge_stacking, exp_weighted_average, poly_weighted_average, and ade_dynamic_error. \n\nSince the models show high disagreement, using a method that combines top-performing models might be better than relying on a single model. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are recommended. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is a stacking method that could handle the heterogeneity. \n\nThe score_preset should be balanced as it's a general approach. I need to ensure that the selected candidates are in the candidate_library. Let me check the names again. Yes, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 are all present. \n\nI should set the top_k for topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to 5 as recommended. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 already has the shrinkage parameter set. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 has l2=50 and top_k=5. \n\nSo, the selected_names would be these three, with the appropriate params_overrides. The rationale is that they handle high disagreement and leverage top models with weighting and stacking.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected top-k mean, inverse-RMSE weighting, and ridge stacking to handle high model disagreement while leveraging top performers with appropriate shrinkage and regularization\"}"
