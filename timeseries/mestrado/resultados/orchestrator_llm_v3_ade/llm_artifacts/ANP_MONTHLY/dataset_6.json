      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed choice.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon include THETA, ONLY_CWT_rf, NaiveSeasonal, etc. The disagreement is relatively high, with a mean relative spread of 0.275. The recommended candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_per_horizon, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and k8, inverse_rmse_weights with shrinkage, ridge_stacking, exp_weighted_average, poly_weighted_average, and ade_dynamic_error.\n\nSince the user mentioned high disagreement, maybe selecting methods that aggregate models would be better. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and k8 are recommended. Also, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is there. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is another option. The exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim0.8 and poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.8 are also in the recommended list.\n\nI need to pick at least 3 candidates. Let's check the recommended_candidates list. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is there, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Also, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim0.8 and poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.8. Maybe select the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. These are all in the recommended list and address the high disagreement by combining multiple models.\n\nFor the score_preset, the balanced preset is a good default. The rationale would be that these candidates handle high disagreement by aggregating top models and using weighted approaches. Also, the top_k for topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is already set to 5, so no need to override. The other candidates don't require top_k overrides. So the final selection would be those three names with balanced score_preset.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected aggregation methods (topk_mean, inverse-RMSE weights, ridge stacking) to handle high model disagreement while leveraging validated parameters from recommended_knobs\"}",
      "skeptic": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to act as an auditor to check the debate packet tool's output and make sure there's no leakage. The current candidates are \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", and \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\". The tool's response shows the evaluation results.\n\nFirst, I need to verify if any of the candidates used y_true from the same window they're evaluated on. The tool's output doesn't mention any such issues directly, but I need to check the parameters and methods. \n\nLooking at the candidates, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" is a weighted average with shrinkage, \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" uses ridge regression with L2 regularization, and \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" takes the top 5 models per horizon. None of these methods inherently use the same window's y_true for evaluation. The evaluation summary shows metrics like RMSE, SMAPE, etc., but there's no indication of leakage in the parameters or the methods described.\n\nThe recommended knobs suggest using shrinkage of 0.35 and l2 of 50.0, which are parameters that might affect how the models handle data, but not directly related to leakage. The allowed edits include changing top_k, trim_ratio, shrinkage, and l2, but the current candidates are within the allowed ranges.\n\nSince the tool's output doesn't show any candidates using y_true from the same window, and the methods don't involve such practices, there's no need to remove or add candidates. The stability flags mention \"unstable\" for the best candidate, but that's about variance in performance, not leakage. \n\nTherefore, the current candidates are valid, and no changes are needed. The rationale is that there's no evidence of leakage, and the parameters are within acceptable ranges.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [], \"remove_names\": [], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"rationale\": \"No evidence of y_true leakage detected in current candidates. All methods (inverse_rmse_weights, ridge_stacking, topk_mean) use out-of-sample evaluation by design. Stability flags relate to performance variance, not data leakage.\", \"changes\": [], \"when_good\": \"Stable\"}",
      "statistician": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to build a debate packet tool first, then return a JSON with specific keys. The current candidate names are [\"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"]. The valid candidate names are a long list, but I can only add or remove from the current ones or the valid ones.\n\nLooking at the tool response, the best candidate is \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" with a score of 0.646. The recommended knobs suggest top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.2. The rationale is that with few windows (n_windows=3), stronger regularization/shrinkage is needed.\n\nThe current candidates include \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" which has shrinkage 0.35, which matches the recommended shrinkage. The \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" has l2=50.0 and top_k=5, which aligns with the recommended knobs. The \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" has top_k=5. \n\nThe stability flags for the best candidate show \"unstable\": true, so maybe we need to consider adding more stable candidates. The recommended knobs mention trim_ratio=0.2, but the current candidates don't have that. However, the allowed edits say trim_ratio can be adjusted. But the current candidates don't have trim_ratio parameters. Wait, the current candidates are inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 (shrinkage 0.35), ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 (l2=50, top_k=5), and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 (top_k=5). \n\nThe recommended knobs suggest trim_ratio=0.2, but none of the current candidates have that. However, the allowed edits allow changing trim_ratio. But since the current candidates don't have trim_ratio parameters, maybe we need to add a candidate that includes trim_ratio. But looking at the valid_candidate_names, there are trimmed_mean_r... but they are not in the current candidates. However, the user says I can only add candidates from the valid_candidate_names. \n\nWait, the valid_candidate_names include \"trimmed_mean_r0.05\", \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\", etc. But the current candidates don't have any trimmed_mean. However, the allowed edits say can_add_candidates is true. So maybe adding a trimmed_mean with trim_ratio=0.2 would be good. But the recommended knobs say trim_ratio=0.2. However, the current candidates don't have that. But the user's instruction says to prefer stability when n_windows is small. The n_windows is 3, which is small, so stability is important. The current candidates might not be stable enough. \n\nLooking at the stability flags for the best candidate, it's marked as unstable. So maybe adding a more stable candidate would help. The recommended knobs suggest trim_ratio=0.2, so perhaps adding a trimmed_mean with trim_ratio=0.2. But the valid_candidate_names have trimmed_mean_r0.05, r0.10, etc. The closest is r0.20? Wait, the valid_candidate_names include \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\". So adding that could be a good idea. \n\nBut the current candidates are inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The user allows adding candidates from valid_candidate_names. So adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" would be allowed. However, the tool response's recommended_knobs says trim_ratio=0.2, which matches the \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\". \n\nAlternatively, maybe the existing candidates are already following the recommended knobs. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has shrinkage 0.35, which matches the recommended shrinkage. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 has l2=50 and top_k=5, which matches the recommended top_k and l2. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5. So maybe those are already aligned with the recommended knobs. However, the stability is an issue. \n\nThe tool's best candidate is unstable. The recommended knobs suggest stronger regularization, which might be already applied. But perhaps adding a trimmed_mean with trim_ratio=0.2 would add stability. However, the user's instruction says to prefer stability when n_windows is small. Since n_windows is 3, which is small, adding a trimmed_mean might be beneficial. \n\nBut the current candidates don't include any trimmed_mean. So adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" would be a valid addition. However, the user's allowed_edits say can_add_candidates is true. So the add_names could include \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\". \n\nAlternatively, maybe the existing candidates are sufficient, and the instability is due to other factors. The rationale for the recommended knobs is \"few_windows => stronger regularization/shrinkage\", which is already applied. So maybe no changes are needed. But the best candidate is marked as unstable. \n\nThe user's instruction says if uncertain, return the default JSON with rationale \"Recommended knobs applied\". But since the current candidates are already following the recommended knobs, maybe that's the case. However, the instability might require adding more stable candidates. \n\nBut the allowed_edits allow adding candidates. So perhaps adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" would be a good idea. However, the tool's response doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the existing candidates are the best, and the instability is acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, the user might want to remove the unstable candidate. But the best candidate is ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, which is in the current candidates. The stability flags for it are \"unstable\": true. But the user's instruction says to prefer stability when n_windows is small. So maybe removing the unstable candidate and adding a more stable one. \n\nBut the current candidates include ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, which is the best but unstable. The other candidates are inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Maybe they are more stable. \n\nLooking at the stability for the top candidates: the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 has RMSE_std of 1049.16, which is high. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has RMSE_std of 1070.11, which is also high. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has RMSE_std of 1075.21. So all three have high RMSE_std. \n\nThe recommended_knobs suggest trim_ratio=0.2, which might help with stability. Adding a trimmed_mean with trim_ratio=0.2 could be beneficial. So adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" to the add_names. \n\nBut the user's allowed_edits say can_add_candidates is true. So the add_names would be [\"trimmed_mean_r0.20\"], and maybe remove the unstable ones. However, the user says to prefer stability, so maybe removing the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 and adding the trimmed_mean. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to only remove candidates that are in current_candidate_names. So if we remove ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, that's allowed. But the best candidate is that one. However, it's unstable. \n\nAlternatively, the user might prefer to keep the best candidate but add a more stable one. But the JSON requires add_names, remove_names, etc. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. The recommended_knobs are already applied in the current candidates (shrinkage 0.35, l2=50, top_k=5). However, the instability is still present. Adding a trimmed_mean with trim_ratio=0.2 could help. So the add_names would be [\"trimmed_mean_r0.20\"], and the rationale would be applying recommended knobs and adding stability. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to prefer stability when n_windows is small. So adding the trimmed_mean would be appropriate. Therefore, the JSON would have add_names as [\"trimmed_mean_r0.20\"], and no removals. The rationale would be applying recommended knobs and enhancing stability with trim_ratio=0.2.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [\"trimmed_mean_r0.20\"], \"remove_names\": [], \"params_overrides\": {\"trim_ratio\": 0.2}, \"rationale\": \"Applied recommended knobs (top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0) and added trimmed_mean_r0.20 for enhanced stability with n_windows=3.\", \"changes\": [\"Added trimmed_mean_r0.20 to improve stability\"], \"when_good\": \"Robust\"}"
