      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some forecasting strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The models have various RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID values. The best_per_horizon indicates that different models win in different horizons, which suggests that there's a lot of heterogeneity. The disagreement metrics show a relative spread mean of 0.288, which is moderate but not extremely high. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, and inverse_rmse_weights, among others.\n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I need to select those that are recommended. The recommended_candidates list includes baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, topk_mean_per_horizon_k8, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim0.8, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.8, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim0.8.\n\nThe user instruction says to select at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, I can pick a few that cover different approaches: a baseline (baseline_mean), a selection method (best_per_horizon_by_validation), a topk_mean (topk_mean_per_horizon_k5), and a weighted method (inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35). However, the example shows that sometimes top_k is overridden based on validation_summary. The validation_summary's meta has top_k=5, so maybe using that.\n\nWait, the example in the rules shows that if top_k is specified in the params, it should be set explicitly. For instance, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5. So I need to check if the params_overrides need to set top_k for any candidates that have it. The recommended_candidates include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 which has top_k=5, so maybe that's already set. However, the user might want to adjust it based on the validation_summary's recommended_knobs. The recommended_knobs mention top_k=5, so maybe keeping that.\n\nAlso, the score_preset can be chosen. The score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. Since the validation has high disagreement, maybe a balanced approach is better. The rationale should explain the selection based on the validation and recommended candidates.\n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. But the example in the rules shows at least 3 candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The example in the user's message shows three candidates, but the instruction says to prefer at least 3. So maybe pick three. Let's go with baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, check if any params need overriding. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which matches the recommended_knobs' top_k=5, so no need to override. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 also has top_k=5, which is set. So the params_overrides might be empty. The score_preset is balanced as per the example. The rationale would mention selecting these based on the validation and recommended candidates, considering the high disagreement and the need for robustness.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for leveraging top-performing models, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for adaptive weighting.
