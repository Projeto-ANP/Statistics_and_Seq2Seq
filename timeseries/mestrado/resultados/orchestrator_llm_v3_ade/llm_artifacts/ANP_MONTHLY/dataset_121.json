      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others. \n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I should focus on the ones recommended. The user mentioned selecting at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there's baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0.\n\nI need to pick a few of these. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are both good as they use top-k models and weighted averages. Also, the ridge_stacking might be a good addition since it's a stacking method. However, the user might prefer a mix of different types. Let me check the parameters. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which is already set. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 also has top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35. \n\nThe score_preset could be balanced as it's a common choice. The rationale should mention selecting these based on validation and recommended candidates. I need to make sure not to include any candidates not in the library. Also, check if any parameters need overriding, but since the recommended ones already have the top_k and shrinkage set, maybe no overrides are needed. \n\nSo, the selected_names would be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and maybe best_per_horizon_by_validation. Wait, the example had three candidates. Let me confirm the example. The example had two, but the user said to prefer at least three. So, including baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and best_per_horizon_by_validation. But the recommended_candidates list includes best_per_horizon_by_validation. \n\nWait, the recommended_candidates in the tool output include best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, etc. So, maybe select those. But the user might want a balance between selection and weighted methods. Let me go with baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. That's four candidates. But the example had two. However, the user said to prefer at least three. So, three is okay. Let me pick baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, maybe include the ridge_stacking. But the example had two, but the user said at least three. So, three is acceptable. \n\nCheck if the params_overrides are needed. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which is already in the params. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35. So no overrides needed. The score_preset is balanced. The rationale would be selecting these based on validation and recommended candidates.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected top-performing combination strategies from validation: baseline mean for stability, top-k mean for robustness, and inverse-RMSE weighting for adaptive model emphasis.\"}"
