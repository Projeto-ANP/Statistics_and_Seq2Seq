      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others. \n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not to invent any. Also, I need to make sure to set top_k explicitly if the params include it. The example shows that if top_k is part of the parameters, I should override it based on validation_summary and recommended_knobs.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, there's a topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. The validation_summary's meta mentions top_k is 5. So, I should use that. Also, the score_preset can be set based on the presets provided, like \"balanced\".\n\nI need to select at least 3 candidates. From the recommended_candidates, baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 are good options. But I need to check if they are in the candidate_library.\n\nLooking at the candidate_library, yes, baseline_mean is there. best_per_horizon_by_validation is also listed. topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is present. inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is in the list. Ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is also there. So, I can select these.\n\nNow, for the params_overrides, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which matches the recommended_knobs. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 has l2=50 and top_k=5. Since the user says to set top_k explicitly, I need to make sure those are included in the overrides if they are part of the params. However, the example shows that if the params include top_k, we should set it. But in the candidate_library, the params for topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 already have top_k=5, so maybe no override is needed. Wait, the example had a case where they set top_k explicitly even if it's in the params. Maybe to ensure consistency with the validation_summary's top_k=5, we should include it in the overrides.\n\nWait, the user instruction says: \"You MUST set top_k explicitly (via params_overrides) for any candidate whose params include top_k.\" So even if the candidate's params already have top_k, we need to set it in the overrides. So for each candidate that has top_k in their params, we need to include it in params_overrides.\n\nLooking at the candidates:\n\n- topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5 in params. So in params_overrides, we need to set {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}}.\n\nSimilarly, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5 in params, so same here.\n\nridge_stacking_l250_topk5 has top_k=5 in params, so include that.\n\nBut the example in the user's message shows that they set top_k even if it's already in the params. So I need to do that.\n\nSo, selected_names would be baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example only had 3 candidates. However, the user says to prefer at least 3. Let me check the recommended_candidates. The recommended_candidates list includes baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0. So maybe pick the first three and one more.\n\nBut the user says to select at least 3. Let me pick baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. That's four. Then set the score_preset to \"balanced\" as per the example. The rationale would be that these candidates are recommended and cover different approaches: baseline, selection, weighted, and stacking.\n\nWait, but the user's example had \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" with top_k=7. But in our case, the top_k is 5. So in the params_overrides, we need to set top_k=5 for those candidates. However, looking at the candidate_library, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 already has top_k=5 in its params. So maybe the user's example was different. But according to the rules, even if the params include top_k, we must set it explicitly in params_overrides. So even if the candidate's params have top_k=5, we need to include it in the overrides.\n\nSo, the params_overrides would be:\n\n{\n  \"baseline_mean\": {},\n  \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\": {},\n  \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5},\n  \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5},\n  \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\": {\"top_k\": 5}\n}\n\nBut wait, the baseline_mean and best_per_horizon_by_validation don't have top_k in their params, so their entries in params_overrides can be empty. However, the user's instruction says to set top_k explicitly for any candidate whose params include top_k. So only the ones with top_k in their params need to have it in the overrides.\n\nSo, the selected_names would be the ones from the recommended_candidates, and the params_overrides would include top_k for those that have it. Then, the score_preset is \"balanced\" as per the example. The rationale would be that these candidates are recommended and cover different strategies.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected recommended candidates covering baseline, selection, and weighted approaches with explicit top_k overrides based on validation_summary\"}"
