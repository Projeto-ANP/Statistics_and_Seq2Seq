      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and others with inverse RMSE weights and ridge stacking.\n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I should focus on the ones recommended. The user mentioned selecting at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there's baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, and others. \n\nI need to make sure I use the correct names from the candidate_library. The example given used topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, setting top_k explicitly. The validation_summary's recommended_knobs have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=5, which matches the candidate_library. \n\nThe score_preset can be chosen based on the user's needs. Since the example used \"balanced\", maybe that's a safe choice here. Also, the force_debate and debate_margin are set to false and 0.02 by default unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, selecting the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 as they are in the recommended list. Also, including best_per_horizon_by_validation for diversity. Need to check if their parameters are correctly set. For example, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which is already in the params, so no override needed. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35, which is also in the params. Ridge stacking has l2=50 and top_k=5. \n\nWait, the example in the user's message had \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" with top_k=7, but in our case, the recommended_knobs have top_k=5. So I should use top_k=5 here. \n\nTherefore, the selected_names would be baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the user said to prefer at least 3. Maybe pick the top three from the recommended list. However, the example had two, but the user said to prefer at least three. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, topk_mean_per_horizon_k8, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0. \n\nSo, selecting three from these. Maybe baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, including ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 as a fourth. But the user said to return at least 3. Let's go with three. Also, check if the params_overrides are needed. For example, if the candidate's params include top_k, but in the recommended_candidates, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 already has top_k=5, so no need to override. Similarly, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35. So no overrides needed. \n\nThus, the selected_names would be [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], with score_preset as \"balanced\" and rationale explaining the selection based on validation and recommended candidates.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for diversified averaging, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for adaptive weighting based on validation performance and recommended strategies.\"}"
