      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed choice.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best_per_horizon has some models winning in different horizons, but the disagreement is moderate with a relative spread mean of around 0.21. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select at least 3 candidates, prefer using top_k based on validation_summary and recommended_knobs. The example shows selecting candidates with explicit top_k values. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there's topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is there. \n\nI should check if the top_k values are set properly. The recommended_knobs mention top_k=5, so maybe using that. Also, the validation_summary's best_per_horizon has unique winners, so maybe including that. However, the user said to select from the candidate_library. The recommended_candidates include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nSo, selecting these three: topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Also, the baseline_mean is a safe choice. Wait, the example included two topk strategies. Maybe include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. But the recommended_candidates have those. \n\nWait, the user's example had \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" with top_k set to 7. But in the tool response, the recommended_candidates have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=5. So I should use that. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is already in the recommended_candidates. \n\nSo, selected_names could be baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the user said to prefer at least 3. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended_candidates list includes baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. \n\nSo, selecting these four: baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. But the user said to return at least 3. Also, the score_preset is balanced. The rationale would be based on the validation_summary and recommended_knobs. \n\nWait, the example had \"selected_names\": [\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], but the user's instruction says to select at least 3. So maybe include three. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. So selecting three of them. Maybe baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. \n\nAlso, the params_overrides need to set top_k if necessary. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 already has top_k=5, so no need to override. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 also has top_k=5. So no overrides needed. \n\nThe score_preset is balanced, which is the default. The rationale would be that these candidates are recommended and balance between different strategies. So the final JSON would include these three names with the balanced preset.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline and top-performing combination strategies based on validation performance and recommended knobs\"}"
