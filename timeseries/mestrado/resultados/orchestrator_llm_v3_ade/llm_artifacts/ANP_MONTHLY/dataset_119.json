      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate names from the provided library and choose a score preset. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the recommended candidates.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best_per_horizon has some models like ONLY_DWT_catboost, FT_catboost, etc. The disagreement is high, with a relative spread mean of 0.335. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there are several options. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are mentioned, which might be good choices. Also, the baseline_mean is a safe option. \n\nI should check the params_overrides. For example, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has a top_k of 5, which is already set. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k 5 and shrinkage 0.35. Since the validation_summary's recommended_knobs have top_k=5, maybe that's the right value. \n\nThe score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. The rationale should explain the selection based on the validation data and recommended candidates. I need to make sure not to use any names not in the candidate_library. \n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, setting the score_preset to \"balanced\" and providing a rationale about using robust methods and handling high disagreement.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to leverage top-performing models, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 to dynamically weight models based on validation performance.
