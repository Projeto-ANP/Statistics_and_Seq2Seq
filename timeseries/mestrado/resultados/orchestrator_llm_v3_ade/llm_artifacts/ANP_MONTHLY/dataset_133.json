      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others. \n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I need to select those that are in the recommended_candidates list. The user mentioned to prefer at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there's baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0.\n\nI should pick a few of these. The baseline_mean is a safe choice. Then, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are both good as they use top-k models and weighted averages. Also, the ridge_stacking might be a good addition since it's a stacking method. \n\nFor the score_preset, the balanced one is probably the best since it's a general approach. The rationale should mention selecting these based on the validation and recommended candidates. I need to make sure to set the top_k parameters where necessary. For example, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 already has top_k=5, so no override needed. But if there's a candidate that requires a different top_k, I should adjust it. However, in the recommended list, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is already set with top_k=5, so no changes there. \n\nWait, the user said to set top_k explicitly if needed. Since the recommended_candidates have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=5, maybe I don't need to override. But looking at the output_schema example, they have params_overrides for topk_mean_per_horizon_k3 with top_k=3. But in our case, the candidate is topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, which already has top_k=5. So no override needed. \n\nSo the selected_names would be baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and maybe ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example shows 3 candidates. Let me check the example again. The example had two candidates with top_k set. But the user said to prefer at least 3. \n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, there are several. Let me pick three: baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, maybe include the ridge_stacking. But the example had two. However, the user said to prefer at least 3. So maybe include three. \n\nThe score_preset is balanced. The rationale would be that these candidates are recommended and balance between different approaches. Also, since the validation has some disagreement, using a combination of selection and weighted methods might help.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for diversified averaging, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for adaptive weighting based on validation performance.\"}"
