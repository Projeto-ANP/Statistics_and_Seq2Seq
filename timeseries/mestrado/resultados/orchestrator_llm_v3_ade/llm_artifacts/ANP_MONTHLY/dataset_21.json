      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate names from the provided library and set the score_preset. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed choice.\n\nLooking at the validation_summary, there are 26 models with 3 windows and a horizon of 12. The best_per_horizon shows that models like FT_catboost, NaiveMovingAverage, and others have some wins. The disagreement metrics have a mean relative spread of around 0.117, which isn't extremely high, but there's some variation.\n\nIn the recommended_candidates, there are several options. The baseline_mean is a safe choice, but maybe combining it with others could be better. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are suggested. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is there. \n\nSince the user mentioned selecting at least 3 candidates, I should pick a few. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 seems reasonable as it averages the top 5 models, which might balance out the errors. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 uses weights based on RMSE with shrinkage, which could handle outliers. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 might provide a more sophisticated combination. \n\nFor the score_preset, the balanced preset gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Since the problem doesn't specify a focus, balanced is a good default. I need to make sure the selected names are in the candidate_library. Checking the names: topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 are all present. \n\nAlso, the params_overrides should set top_k where necessary. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 already has top_k=5, so no override needed. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5 as per the params. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 has top_k=5. So no overrides are needed here. \n\nTherefore, selecting these three candidates with the balanced score_preset makes sense. The rationale would be that they combine different approaches: averaging top models, weighted by inverse RMSE with shrinkage, and ridge stacking, which should provide a robust combination.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected diverse combination strategies: top-k averaging, inverse-RMSE weighting with shrinkage, and ridge stacking.
