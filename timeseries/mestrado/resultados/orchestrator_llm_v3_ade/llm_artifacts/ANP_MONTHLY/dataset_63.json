      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate names from the provided library and set parameters. First, I need to check the validation summary and recommended candidates.\n\nLooking at the validation_summary, there are 26 models with 3 windows and a horizon of 12. The best models per horizon vary, and there's high disagreement. The recommended_knobs suggest candidates like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_single, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, and inverse_rmse_weights. \n\nThe user's example shows selecting candidates with explicit top_k. Since the recommended_candidates include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, maybe those are good choices. Also, the score_preset could be \"balanced\" as per the example. \n\nI should select at least 3 candidates. Let's pick baseline_mean for simplicity, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Check if their parameters are set correctly. The top_k for topk_mean is 5, which matches the recommended. For inverse_rmse_weights, top_k is 5 and shrinkage 0.35, which is in the recommended list. \n\nSet score_preset to \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. No need for force_debate unless there's a close call, but with the given data, it's safe to not force debate. The rationale would be selecting top_k based on validation_summary and recommended_knobs.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for robustness, topk_mean for horizon-specific aggregation, and inverse_rmse_weights with shrinkage to balance model contributions based on validation performance\"}"
