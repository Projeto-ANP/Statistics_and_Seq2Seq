      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs suggest candidates like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_single_by_validation, and others. The candidate_library has a lot of options, including various trimmed means, top-k means, inverse RMSE weights, ridge stacking, etc.\n\nThe user's instructions say to select candidate names only from the candidate_library and not invent any. Also, need to set top_k explicitly if the params include it. The example shows selecting candidates with top_k based on validation_summary and recommended_knobs.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, there's \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\". The validation_summary's disagreement has a relative_spread_mean of 3.69, which is moderate. Since there's some disagreement, maybe using a weighted approach could be better. The recommended_candidates include inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, which uses shrinkage. Also, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is suggested with top_k=5. \n\nThe score_presets have \"balanced\" as one option. The user might prefer a balanced approach. Also, the example uses \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" with top_k=7, but in the recommended_candidates, the top_k is 5. So maybe stick with the recommended top_k.\n\nSo, selecting \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" as they are in the recommended list. Also, include \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\" as another candidate. Check if they are in the candidate_library. Yes, they are. \n\nNeed to make sure to set top_k for any candidate that requires it. Both topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 have top_k=5. The params_overrides would be empty if the top_k is already set in the candidate's params. Wait, the candidate's params for inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 have top_k=5, so no need to override. Similarly, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5. So params_overrides can be empty. \n\nThe score_preset is \"balanced\" as per the example. The rationale would be that these candidates balance between top-k selection and weighted averaging, leveraging past validation performance and shrinkage to handle disagreement.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected top-k mean and inverse-RMSE weighted approaches to balance model disagreement, paired with per-horizon validation selection to leverage strong performers\"}"
