      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some forecasting strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others. \n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I should focus on the ones recommended. The user mentioned selecting at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there's baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0.\n\nI need to choose names that are in the candidate_library. The example given used topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. But in the recommended_candidates, there's also best_per_horizon_by_validation. Maybe include that as well. Also, the score_preset can be set based on the presets provided. The balanced preset is a good default. \n\nWait, the user said to prefer returning at least 3 candidates. So maybe select baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Also, check if any parameters need overriding. For example, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has a top_k of 5, which is already set in the params. But the recommended_knobs have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=5, so no need to override. \n\nAlternatively, maybe include inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 as another candidate. That's also in the recommended list. So selected_names could be [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"]. Then set the score_preset to \"balanced\" as it's a common choice. The rationale would be that these candidates balance simplicity, selection based on validation, and weighted averaging with shrinkage.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for robustness, per-horizon selection for adaptability, and inverse-RMSE weighting with shrinkage to balance model performance\"}"
