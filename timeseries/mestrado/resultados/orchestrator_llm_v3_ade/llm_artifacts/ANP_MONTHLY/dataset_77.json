      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate names from the provided library and set parameters. First, I need to look at the validation summary and recommended candidates.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 3 windows, 26 models, and a horizon of 12. The models have varying RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID values. The best_per_horizon has some models like rf, ONLY_DWT_svr, NaiveSeasonal, etc. The disagreement metrics are high, with a relative spread mean of 145.78 and p90 of 253.93. This suggests that models disagree a lot, so maybe using a method that combines multiple models would be better.\n\nLooking at the recommended_knobs, there are several candidates. The top ones include baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_single, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, inverse_rmse_weights, ridge_stacking, exp_weighted_average, and poly_weighted_average.\n\nSince the disagreement is high, using a combination method that averages top models might be good. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are recommended. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is there. But the user's example shows selecting candidates with explicit top_k parameters.\n\nThe example given used topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 with top_k set to 7. But in the recommended_candidates, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5. However, the validation_summary's recommended_knobs has a top_k of 5. But the user's example might have adjusted it based on validation_summary. Wait, the user's example had top_k=7, but in the current case, the recommended top_k is 5. However, the validation_summary's disagreement is high, so maybe increasing top_k could help include more models. But the user's example might have used a different approach.\n\nWait, the user's example had a top_k of 7, but in the current case, the recommended top_k is 5. However, the user's instruction says to choose top_k based on validation_summary and recommended_knobs. The recommended_knobs have a top_k of 5, but the validation_summary's disagreement is high. Maybe the user should use a higher top_k to include more models, but the available candidates have top_k values like 5, 8, etc. The recommended_candidates include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and topk_mean_per_horizon_k8. Since the disagreement is high, maybe selecting a higher k like 8 could be better. However, the example used k5 with top_k=7, but that might not be available here.\n\nLooking at the candidate_library, there are candidates like topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, topk_mean_per_horizon_k8, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, etc. The recommended_candidates include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and topk_mean_per_horizon_k8. Also, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is there. Since the validation_summary's disagreement is high, using a method that combines multiple models (like topk_mean with higher k or inverse_rmse_weights) might be better. Also, the ridge_stacking is another option.\n\nThe score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. The user might prefer a balanced approach. The example used \"balanced\" as the score_preset. So, selecting candidates that are robust to disagreement, like inverse_rmse_weights with shrinkage, and topk_mean with a higher k. Also, the baseline_mean and robust_median are safe choices.\n\nSo, possible candidates could be baseline_mean, robust_median, topk_mean_per_horizon_k8, inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But need to check if these are in the recommended_candidates. The recommended_candidates include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and k8, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and k8_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Also, exp_weighted_average and poly_weighted_average are there.\n\nBut the user's example had three candidates. Maybe select three here. Let's pick topk_mean_per_horizon_k8, inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Also, include baseline_mean for a baseline comparison. However, the example had three candidates. Alternatively, the user might prefer a mix of selection and weighted methods. Also, considering the high disagreement, using a weighted method with shrinkage might help. So, maybe select inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But need to check if these are in the recommended_candidates.\n\nLooking back, the recommended_candidates include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Also, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim0.8 and poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.8 are there. So, perhaps selecting those three: topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Also, the example had a score_preset of \"balanced\". So, the final selection would be these three candidates, with the score_preset as \"balanced\".\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected top-k mean, inverse-RMSE weights, and ridge stacking methods to handle high model disagreement while leveraging validated parameter configurations.\"}",
      "skeptic": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to act as an auditor to evaluate the current candidates in the debate packet. The current candidates are \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", and \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\". The tool provided a detailed evaluation, so I need to analyze the results to decide if any changes are needed.\n\nFirst, looking at the candidate rankings. The top candidates in the ranking are \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", and \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\". Their scores are 0.6898, 0.7017, and 0.7068 respectively. The score margin between the top two is 0.0118, which is relatively small. However, the recommended knobs suggest using top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, and trim_ratio=0.2. The current candidates have top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=250, and trim_ratio not applicable here.\n\nWait, the current candidates include \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" which has l2=250. The recommended l2 is 50.0. That's a significant difference. Maybe adjusting l2 could improve performance. However, the user's rules say not to change params.method, but the allowed edits include changing l2. Wait, the allowed_edits says params_allowed includes l2, so maybe that's allowed. But the user's instruction says not to change params.method. Wait, the allowed_edits mention that can't change method, but l2 is a parameter, not the method. So perhaps adjusting l2 is allowed.\n\nBut looking at the current candidates, \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" has l2=250. The recommended l2 is 50.0. Maybe that's a parameter that can be adjusted. However, the user's instruction says not to change params.method, but l2 is a hyperparameter, not the method. So maybe that's allowed. However, the current candidates are using l2=250, which is higher than the recommended 50.0. But the tool's recommended knobs are based on few windows, suggesting stronger regularization. However, the current candidates might be using a different l2 value. But the user's allowed edits include changing l2, so perhaps we can adjust that.\n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names include \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", which has l2=250. The recommended l2 is 50.0. So maybe that's a parameter that can be adjusted. However, the user's instruction says not to change params.method, but l2 is a parameter, not the method. So perhaps that's allowed. However, the user's current setup might be using l2=250, but the recommended is 50.0. But the tool's allowed_edits say that l2 can be adjusted between 0.1 and 1000. So maybe changing l2 from 250 to 50 is a possible improvement.\n\nBut the user's current candidates are already using l2=250. However, the recommended l2 is 50.0. So maybe the current candidate is not optimal. However, the user's allowed_edits allow changing l2. But the user's instruction says not to change params.method. Wait, the allowed_edits say \"cannot_change_method\": true. So changing l2 is allowed as it's a parameter, not the method. So perhaps we can suggest changing l2 from 250 to 50.0 for the ridge_stacking candidate.\n\nBut the current candidates are \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", and \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\". The tool's recommended knobs suggest l2=50.0. So maybe the ridge_stacking candidate's l2 is too high. However, the user's allowed_edits allow changing l2. But the user's current_candidate_names include \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", which is using l2=250. So perhaps we can suggest changing that parameter.\n\nBut the user's instruction says that I can only remove or add candidates from the valid_candidate_names. The allowed_edits say can_add_candidates and can_remove_candidates are true. So maybe we can remove the current ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 and add a candidate with l2=50.0. However, the valid_candidate_names include \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" but not \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" with l2=50.0. Wait, the valid_candidate_names include \"ridge_stacking_l210_topk3\", \"ridge_stacking_l210_topk5\", \"ridge_stacking_l220_topk3\", \"ridge_stacking_l220_topk5\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk3\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\". So there's no candidate with l2=50.0. The closest is l2=250. So maybe the user can't change l2 to 50.0 because that's not in the valid_candidate_names. Therefore, the current candidates can't be modified in terms of l2, since the valid_candidate_names don't have that. So the allowed_edits can_add_candidates and can_remove_candidates are true, but the user can't change parameters of existing candidates, only add or remove them.\n\nWait, the allowed_edits say \"params_allowed\": [\"top_k\", \"trim_ratio\", \"shrinkage\", \"l2\"], but the user can't change the method. However, the current candidates are using specific parameters. For example, \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" has l2=250. If the user wants to change l2 to 50, they would need to add a new candidate with l2=50, like \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" but with l2=50. But the valid_candidate_names don't have that. The valid_candidate_names include \"ridge_stacking_l210_topk5\", \"ridge_stacking_l220_topk5\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\". So l2=10, 20, 50. Wait, the valid_candidate_names have \"ridge_stacking_l210_topk5\", \"ridge_stacking_l220_topk5\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\". So l2=10, 20, 50. The recommended l2 is 50.0. So the current candidate \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" is already using l2=50. Wait, no, the name is \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", which probably means l2=250. Wait, the name might be a typo. Wait, looking at the valid_candidate_names, there's \"ridge_stacking_l210_topk5\", \"ridge_stacking_l220_topk5\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\". So l2 is 10, 20, 50. Wait, the name is \"ridge_stacking_l210_topk5\" which would be l2=10? Or is it l2=210? Wait, the name is \"ridge_stacking_l210_topk5\" which might be l2=210? Or is it l2=10? The naming convention is unclear. But the user's current_candidate_names include \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", which might be l2=250. However, the valid_candidate_names have \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", which would be l2=50? Or 250? This is confusing. Maybe the l2 parameter in the name is the value. For example, \"ridge_stacking_l210_topk5\" would be l2=10. So the current candidate \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" has l2=50. But the recommended l2 is 50.0. So that's already matching. Therefore, the current candidate is using the recommended l2=50. So no need to change that.\n\nWait, the recommended knobs say l2=50.0. The current candidate is \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", which if the l2 is 50, then that's correct. But the name might be a typo. Alternatively, maybe the l2 in the name is 250. But the valid_candidate_names have \"ridge_stacking_l210_topk5\", \"ridge_stacking_l220_topk5\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\". So l2 is 10, 20, 50. Therefore, the current candidate \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" has l2=50. Which matches the recommended l2=50.0. So that's good.\n\nNow, looking at the candidate rankings. The top candidates are \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" (score 0.6898), \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" (0.7017), and \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" (0.7068). The score margin between the top two is 0.0118, which is small. However, the recommended knobs suggest top_k=5, which is already used by the current candidates. The shrinkage is 0.35, which is used by \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\". The trim_ratio is 0.2, but the current candidates don't have trim_ratio parameters. The current candidates are \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" (shrinkage=0.35), \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" (l2=50), and \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" (top_k=5). \n\nLooking at the stability flags, the best candidate \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" has \"unstable\": true. The stability flags for \"rmse_std_over_rmse\" is 0.631, which is high, indicating high variance. This might be a problem. The recommended knobs suggest stronger regularization, which might help with stability. However, the current candidate \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" is already using shrinkage=0.35, which is part of the recommended knobs. But it's still unstable. \n\nThe per_horizon_winners show that for RMSE, \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" are leading. For SMAPE, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" is leading in some horizons. However, the overall score of \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" is the highest. But the stability of \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" is poor. \n\nThe user's instruction says to reject or rewrite any strategy that uses y_true from the same window being evaluated. But the current candidates don't seem to be using y_true from the same window. However, the tool's evaluation might have already considered that. \n\nNow, considering the allowed edits, the user can add or remove candidates. The current candidates are \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", and \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\". The recommended knobs suggest top_k=5, which is already used. The shrinkage is 0.35, which is used by \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\". The l2 is 50, which is used by \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\". The trim_ratio is 0.2, but the current candidates don't have trim_ratio parameters. However, the valid_candidate_names include \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\", which has trim_ratio=0.2. Maybe adding that could help with stability. \n\nThe current candidates have \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" which is unstable. Maybe removing it and adding a more stable candidate. The valid_candidate_names include \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" which has trim_ratio=0.2, which is recommended. The score for \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" in the universe ranking is 0.5944, which is lower than the current candidates. However, the stability might be better. \n\nAlternatively, the current candidate \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" has a high RMSE_std, which might be due to instability. The recommended knobs suggest stronger regularization, but the current candidate is already using shrinkage=0.35. However, the trim_ratio is not applied here. Adding a trimmed_mean with trim_ratio=0.2 might help. \n\nBut the user's allowed_edits say can_add_candidates and can_remove_candidates. So maybe removing the unstable \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" and adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" which has better stability. However, the score of \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" is lower than the current candidates. But the user's goal is to avoid strategies that use y_true from the same window. The current candidates might not be doing that, but the tool's evaluation might have already considered that. \n\nAlternatively, the current candidates are already using the recommended parameters, but the \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" is unstable. The user might want to remove it and add a more stable candidate. However, the valid_candidate_names include \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" which has trim_ratio=0.2. Adding that could be a good move. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to only use names from valid_candidate_names. So adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" is allowed. However, the current candidate \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" is in the current_candidate_names. If we remove it and add \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\", that might improve stability. \n\nBut the tool's recommended knobs suggest using trim_ratio=0.2, which is used by \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\". However, the score of \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" is lower than the current candidates. But the user might prioritize stability over score. \n\nAlternatively, the current candidates are already using the recommended parameters, and the instability is due to other factors. The user might not want to change anything if the current setup is acceptable. \n\nGiven the small score margin between the top candidates and the instability of \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", maybe it's better to remove the unstable one and add a more stable candidate. However, the user's allowed_edits allow adding and removing. \n\nSo the possible changes would be: remove \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" and add \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\". But the user's current_candidate_names include \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", which is unstable. The rationale would be that the current candidate is unstable, and adding a more stable one could improve performance. \n\nBut the tool's evaluation might not have enough data to confirm that. The user's instruction says to be an auditor, so if there's instability, it's a reason to change. However, the score of the new candidate is lower. But the user might prefer stability. \n\nAlternatively, since the score margin is small, maybe keeping the current candidates is acceptable. The user might not want to change unless there's a clear reason. \n\nIn the tool's output, the \"best\" candidate is \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" but it's marked as unstable. The \"stability_flags\" show \"unstable\": true. So this is a red flag. Therefore, removing it and adding a more stable candidate like \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" would be a good move. \n\nSo the changes would be: remove \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" and add \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\". The rationale is that the current candidate is unstable, and adding a more stable one could improve reliability. The when_good would be when stability is a priority over slight score differences.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [\"trimmed_mean_r0.20\"], \"remove_names\": [\"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"rationale\": \"Current candidate 'inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35' is marked as unstable (high RMSE_std and MAPE_std).

      "statistician": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to build a debate packet tool first, then return a JSON with specific keys. The current candidates are \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", and \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\". The tool response has a lot of data, including validation summaries, candidate rankings, and recommended knobs.\n\nFirst, I need to check the recommended knobs. The recommended_knobs suggest top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.2. The rationale is \"few_windows => stronger regularization/shrinkage\". Since the n_windows is 3, which is small, stability is important. The current candidates include \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" which has trim_ratio 0.2, matching the recommendation. However, the current \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" has l2=250, but the recommended is l2=50.0. Maybe that's a parameter to adjust. But the user said not to change params.method, only override parameters. Wait, the allowed_edits include l2, so maybe I can adjust that. However, the current_candidate_names include \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", which has l2=250. The recommended is l2=50.0. But the user instructions say not to change params.method, but params_overrides are allowed. Wait, the allowed_edits have \"params_allowed\" including l2. So perhaps I can override the l2 parameter for the ridge stacking model. However, the current candidate is \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", which has l2=250. The recommended is l2=50.0. So maybe I should override that parameter. But the user might not want to change existing candidates unless necessary. Alternatively, maybe the recommended knobs suggest adding a candidate with l2=50.0. But the valid_candidate_names include \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", \"ridge_stacking_l2100_topk5\", etc. Wait, the valid_candidate_names have \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" and \"ridge_stacking_l210_topk5\", etc. So maybe there's a candidate with l2=50.0? Let me check the valid_candidate_names. Looking through them, there's \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", \"ridge_stacking_l2100_topk5\", \"ridge_stacking_l210_topk5\", \"ridge_stacking_l220_topk5\", etc. So l2=50.0 isn't present. The closest is l2=250, 100, 10, 20. The recommended is l2=50.0, which isn't in the valid_candidate_names. Therefore, maybe I can't add that. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to adjust the existing parameters. But the allowed_edits say can_add_candidates and can_remove_candidates. So perhaps the current candidates are not optimal. For example, the recommended trim_ratio is 0.2, which is already in \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\". The top_k is 5, which is in \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\". The shrinkage is 0.35, but none of the current candidates have that parameter. The shrinkage parameter is part of the inverse_rmse_weights or exp_weighted_average candidates. However, the current candidates don't include those. So maybe adding a candidate with shrinkage=0.35 would be better. But the valid_candidate_names include \"inverse_rmse_weights_k10_sh0.35\", etc. So maybe adding one of those. But the user's current_candidate_names are the ones listed. The tool's recommended_knobs suggest using shrinkage=0.35. So perhaps adding a candidate like \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" (assuming k=5 as per top_k=5). But the user's current_candidate_names don't have that. However, the allowed_edits say can_add_candidates. So maybe adding such a candidate. But the user's instruction says to only add names from valid_candidate_names. Let me check if \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" is in valid_candidate_names. Looking at the list, yes, there's \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\". So that's a valid name. Therefore, adding that candidate might be beneficial. Also, the current candidates include \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" which has l2=250, but the recommended is l2=50.0. However, there's no candidate with l2=50.0 in valid_candidate_names. The closest is l2=250, 100, 10, 20. So maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the user should remove the current ridge stacking candidate and add a different one. But the user's current_candidate_names include \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", which is a valid name. However, the recommended l2 is 50.0, which isn't present. So perhaps that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the current candidates are okay, and the recommended knobs are just suggestions. The user's current candidates are \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", and \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\". The recommended top_k is 5, which matches the \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\". The trim_ratio is 0.2, which matches \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\". The shrinkage is 0.35, which could be addressed by adding an inverse_rmse_weights candidate with shrinkage 0.35. So adding \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" (since top_k is 5). But the user's current_candidate_names don't have that. So adding that would be a valid move. However, the user's current_candidate_names are the ones provided, and the allowed_edits allow adding. Therefore, the add_names would be \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\". Also, the current \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" has l2=250, but the recommended is 50.0. However, since that's not available, maybe it's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the user should remove the ridge stacking candidate and add a different one. But the user might not want to remove existing candidates unless necessary. The rationale would be to follow the recommended knobs, adding the inverse_rmse_weights candidate with shrinkage 0.35 and k=5. Also, the current \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" already has top_k=5, which matches the recommendation. The \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" has trim_ratio=0.2, which is correct. So the changes would be adding the inverse_rmse_weights candidate. The remove_names would be empty unless there's a need to remove something. The params_overrides might not be needed if the existing candidates can't be adjusted. But the user can't change the method, only override parameters. Wait, the allowed_edits include params_allowed, but the current candidates are fixed. So maybe the params_overrides are not applicable here. Therefore, the final JSON would have add_names as [\"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], remove_names as empty, params_overrides as empty, rationale as applying recommended knobs, changes as adding the new candidate, and when_good as \"Robust\".\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [\"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"remove_names\": [], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"rationale\": \"Recommended knobs applied: top_k=5, trim_ratio=0.2, shrinkage=0.35.
