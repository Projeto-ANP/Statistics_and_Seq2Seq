      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate names from the provided library and set the score_preset. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed choice.\n\nLooking at the validation_summary, there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best_per_horizon has some models like FT_svr, ONLY_FT_rf, etc. The disagreement metrics show a relative spread mean of around 0.12, which isn't extremely high, but there's some variation. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others.\n\nThe user's example shows selecting candidates with explicit top_k parameters. Since the recommended_candidates have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, those are good candidates. Also, the baseline_mean is a safe choice. The score_preset could be \"balanced\" as per the example. I should check if the top_k values are set correctly. The recommended_knobs suggest top_k=5, so I'll use that. Need to make sure not to invent any names and only use those in the candidate_library. The rationale should mention choosing based on validation_summary and recommended_knobs.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline and top-performing combination strategies based on validation_summary and recommended_knobs, using top_k=5 as suggested by the analysis\"}"
