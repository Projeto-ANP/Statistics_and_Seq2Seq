      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed decision.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best_per_horizon has some models winning in different horizons, but there's a lot of disagreement, as indicated by the relative_spread_mean of 0.43. The recommended_candidates include several options like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, and various weighted methods.\n\nSince the user mentioned high disagreement, maybe a robust method would be better. The baseline_mean is a safe choice, but the trimmed_mean might handle outliers better. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and k8 could be good since they average the top models, which might reduce variance. The inverse_rmse_weights with shrinkage could also be effective by giving more weight to better-performing models.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are suggested. Also, the ridge_stacking and EWA methods are there. However, with only 3 windows, methods that require more data might be unstable. The user might prefer a balance between robustness and leveraging model performance.\n\nI should select at least three candidates. Maybe baseline_mean for simplicity, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for averaging top models, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for weighted averaging. The score_preset could be balanced as it's a general approach. I need to ensure that any top_k parameters are set explicitly based on the validation data. Since the recommended_knobs suggest top_k=5, I'll use that. Also, check if the candidates are in the candidate_library. Yes, they are. So the final selection would include these three with appropriate parameters.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected robust baseline, top-k averaging for stability, and inverse-RMSE weighting with shrinkage to balance model performance and disagreement\"}",
      "skeptic": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to act as an auditor to evaluate the current candidates in the debate packet. The current candidates are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The tool provided a detailed validation summary and candidate rankings.\n\nFirst, I need to check if any of the current candidates should be removed or if new ones should be added. The validation summary shows that the candidate rankings have baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. The scores are close, with inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 having the highest score among the three. However, the stability flags for baseline_mean indicate it's unstable due to high RMSE standard deviation. \n\nLooking at the recommended knobs, the tool suggests a shrinkage of 0.35, which is already part of the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 candidate. This might mean that this candidate is already optimized for the current setup. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has a slightly lower score but similar stability. The baseline_mean, while having a lower score, is marked as unstable. \n\nSince the task is to avoid using y_true from the same window, I need to ensure that the candidates don't leak information. The current candidates don't seem to have that issue. However, the baseline_mean's instability might make it a weaker choice. The tool's recommended knobs suggest parameters that could be used to adjust existing candidates or add new ones. \n\nLooking at the allowed edits, we can add or remove candidates. The universe includes other candidates like trimmed_mean_r0.05, which has a similar score to baseline_mean. However, since the user hasn't mentioned adding new candidates, maybe it's better to stick with the current ones unless there's a clear improvement. \n\nThe score margin between the top candidates is small (around 0.016), so there's not a huge difference. However, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has the highest score and better stability compared to baseline_mean. Maybe removing baseline_mean could be considered, but the user hasn't provided a reason to do so. \n\nAlternatively, adding a candidate that uses the recommended parameters, like a trimmed_mean with a trim_ratio of 0.2, might be beneficial. But the user's current candidates don't include that. However, the allowed edits say we can add candidates from the valid list. The valid_candidate_names include trimmed_mean_r0.20, which might be a good candidate to add. \n\nBut the user's current_candidate_names don't have that. Since the tool allows adding, maybe adding trimmed_mean_r0.20 could improve stability. However, the rationale must be based on the tool's output. The tool's recommended knobs mention trim_ratio 0.2, so adding a candidate with that parameter might be justified. \n\nBut the current candidates are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The tool's universe includes trimmed_mean_r0.20, which is a valid candidate. Adding it could be a good move. However, the user might not want to add unless there's a clear benefit. \n\nAlternatively, since the baseline_mean is unstable, removing it might be better. The tool's best candidate is baseline_mean, but it's marked as unstable. However, the recommended knobs suggest stronger regularization, which might mean that the current candidates could be adjusted. \n\nIn the end, considering the stability of baseline_mean and the slight edge of inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, maybe removing baseline_mean and adding a more stable candidate like trimmed_mean_r0.20 would be better. But I need to check if that's allowed. The allowed_edits say can_add_candidates is true, so adding trimmed_mean_r0.20 is possible. However, the user's current_candidate_names don't include it, so adding it would be valid. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to only use names from valid_candidate_names. Trimmed_mean_r0.20 is in the valid list. So, adding that could be a good move. However, the current candidates might be sufficient. The score differences are small, and the tool's best is baseline_mean, even though it's unstable. \n\nAlternatively, since the user is an auditor, maybe the best approach is to not remove any candidates but suggest adding a more stable one. However, the user's instruction says to return changes based on the tool's output. The tool's recommended knobs suggest trim_ratio 0.2, which is in the valid_candidate_names as trimmed_mean_r0.20. \n\nSo, adding trimmed_mean_r0.20 and removing baseline_mean might be the best action. But I need to check if the tool's output supports that. The tool's best candidate is baseline_mean, but it's unstable. The recommended knobs suggest parameters that could be used to adjust existing candidates. However, the current candidates don't use those parameters. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the current candidates are acceptable, and no changes are needed. The score differences are minimal, and the tool's allowed_edits don't force changes. The user might prefer stability over slight score improvements. \n\nIn conclusion, since the tool's best is baseline_mean but it's unstable, and there's a recommended trim_ratio of 0.2, adding trimmed_mean_r0.20 could be a good move. However, the user might not want to add unless there's a clear benefit. Given the small score differences and the instability of baseline_mean, it's possible that removing baseline_mean and adding trimmed_mean_r0.20 would be better. But I need to ensure that the rationale is based on the tool's output.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [\"trimmed_mean_r0.20\"], \"remove_names\": [\"baseline_mean\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"rationale\": \"baseline_mean is unstable (rmse_std_over_rmse=0.255) while trimmed_mean_r0.20 (not in current list) aligns with recommended trim_ratio=0.2 for few_windows scenarios. inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 already incorporates optimal shrinkage (0.35) from recommended knobs.\", \"changes\": [\"Add trimmed_mean_r0.20 for stability\", \"Remove unstable baseline_mean\"], \"when_good\": \"When stability is prioritized over marginal score improvements (current score margin=0.016)\"}",

However, the tool's best candidate is \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", which is already in the current list. The other candidates are also aligned with the knobs.
