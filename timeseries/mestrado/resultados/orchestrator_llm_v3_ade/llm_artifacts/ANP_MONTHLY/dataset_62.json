      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some forecasting strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and candidate_library to select appropriate candidates.\n\nLooking at the validation_summary, there are 26 models with varying RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID scores. The best_per_horizon shows that models like THETA, DWT_catboost, and others perform well in different horizons. The disagreement metrics indicate some spread in performance, but not extremely high. The recommended_knobs suggest candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and others with inverse RMSE weights and ridge stacking.\n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, including baselines, selection methods, weighted averages, and stacking. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. These seem to be the top choices based on the validation results.\n\nI need to select at least three candidates. The baseline_mean is a safe choice as it's a simple average. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is recommended and uses a top-k approach which might average out some of the model discrepancies. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is another weighted method that could give more weight to better-performing models. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 might be a good addition as it uses a stacking approach with regularization.\n\nI should check if the parameters are correctly set. For example, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, which is already in the params. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 has l2=50 and top_k=5. All these parameters are present in the candidate_library, so no overrides are needed unless specified. The user mentioned to set top_k explicitly if needed, but since the recommended candidates already have the top_k set, maybe no overrides are necessary here.\n\nThe score_preset can be \"balanced\" as it's a common choice unless there's a specific focus. The rationale should explain the selection based on the validation results and recommended candidates. Since the user wants at least three candidates, I'll pick baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Maybe also include ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 for diversity in methods.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for diversified averaging, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for adaptive weighting, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 for regularization-based ensemble.
