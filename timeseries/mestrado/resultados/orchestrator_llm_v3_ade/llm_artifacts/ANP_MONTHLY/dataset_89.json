      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided validation summary and candidate library. First, I need to make sure I only use the names from the candidate_library. The validation_summary shows that there's high disagreement among models, so maybe strategies that handle disagreement well would be good. The recommended_candidates include things like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_single, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, inverse_rmse_weights, ridge_stacking, exp_weighted_average, and poly_weighted_average.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are suggested. Also, the validation_summary mentions that the relative spread is high, so using a method that combines multiple models might be better. The baseline_mean is a safe choice, but maybe adding some weighted methods would be better. The user example had topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 with top_k set to 7, but in the candidate_library, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5. Wait, the user's example might have different parameters, but here the candidate_library has top_k=5 for topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Also, the recommended_knobs suggest top_k=5. So maybe selecting topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, the best_per_horizon_by_validation is another candidate. But the user wants at least 3 candidates. Let me check the candidate_library again.\n\nIn the recommended_candidates, there's topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Also, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim0.8 and poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.8 are there. So maybe selecting those. But the user example had three candidates. Let me check the parameters. The user's example had top_k=7, but here the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5. However, the validation_summary's recommended_knobs has top_k=5. So maybe using that. Also, the score_preset could be balanced as per the example. So the selected_names could be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. But need to make sure they are in the candidate_library. Yes, those names are present. Also, the rationale would be based on the high disagreement and the need for robust methods. So the JSON would include those three names, set the top_k for the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to 5 (though it's already set in the params), and choose a score_preset like balanced.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected robust aggregation methods (trimmed mean, top-k averaging, and inverse-RMSE weighting) to handle high model disagreement while maintaining stability with limited windows (n=3).
