    "raw": {
      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed choice.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, indicating high disagreement among models. The disagreement's relative spread mean is 0.378, which is moderate but not extremely high. The recommended candidates include baseline methods like mean and median, trimmed mean, selection methods like best_per_horizon and topk_mean, and weighted methods like inverse_rmse_weights and ridge stacking.\n\nSince the user mentioned high disagreement, maybe selecting methods that aggregate multiple models would be better. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are recommended. Also, the baseline_mean is a safe choice. However, the recommended_candidates list includes topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. \n\nLooking at the params_overrides, the example uses topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=7, but in the candidate_library, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5. Wait, the user's example might have a different top_k. But according to the tool's recommended_candidates, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is suggested with top_k=5. However, the validation_summary's recommended_knobs suggests top_k=5. \n\nBut the user's example might have a different top_k. Wait, the user's example shows topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=7, but in the candidate_library, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5. So maybe the example is outdated. However, the current tool output's recommended_candidates include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. \n\nAlso, the score_preset is set to \"balanced\" by default. The user might want to select at least three candidates. Let me check the recommended_candidates list again. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, robust_trimmed_mean_0.20, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, topk_mean_per_horizon_k8, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim0.8, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.8, ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim0.8.\n\nSo, selecting three candidates from these. Maybe baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, check if they need top_k overrides. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5 as per the params, so no override needed. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35. So, no overrides needed. \n\nThe score_preset can be \"balanced\" as per the example. The rationale would be selecting topk and inverse_rmse methods due to high disagreement and using baseline as a fallback. Also, the force_debate is false unless there's a need, but with three candidates, maybe not. So the final JSON would include these three names with the balanced preset.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for robust aggregation during high disagreement, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for dynamic weighting based on validation performance.\"}",
      "skeptic": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to act as an auditor to evaluate the debate packet results and suggest changes to the current candidates. The current candidates are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The tool response has provided detailed validation summaries, candidate rankings, and recommended knobs.\n\nFirst, I need to check if any of the current candidates are underperforming based on the scores. The candidate_ranking_top shows that baseline_mean has a score of 0.6606, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has 0.6705, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has 0.6746. The scores are close, but inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is slightly better. However, the score margin between the top two is 0.0098, which is small. \n\nLooking at the per_horizon_winners, baseline_mean wins in 6 out of 12 horizons for RMSE, while the other two candidates split the rest. For SMAPE and MAPE, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has more wins. However, the stability flags for baseline_mean show that it's marked as unstable with rmse_std_over_rmse around 0.497, which is quite high. This suggests that baseline_mean might not be reliable due to high variance.\n\nThe recommended knobs suggest using top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.2. The current candidates include inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, which has shrinkage 0.35, so that's aligned. However, the trim_ratio for the current candidates isn't specified, but the recommended is 0.2. Maybe there's a better candidate with trim_ratio 0.2 that's not in the current list.\n\nLooking at the universe of valid candidates, there's inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 (which is already in current), but also others like inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.25, which might have a trim_ratio of 0.25. Wait, the recommended trim_ratio is 0.2, so maybe candidates with trim_ratio 0.2 are better. However, in the valid_candidate_names, there's inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.25, but not exactly 0.2. Hmm, maybe the user can't add those unless they are in the valid list. The valid_candidate_names include inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.25, but the recommended is 0.2. Maybe there's a candidate with shrinkage 0.2, but I don't see that in the list. Alternatively, maybe the current candidates are okay, but the baseline_mean is unstable.\n\nSince the allowed_edits say can_remove_candidates is true, maybe removing baseline_mean is a good idea because it's unstable. The rationale would be that baseline_mean has high RMSE standard deviation, making it unstable. Then, adding candidates that have better scores and stability. Looking at the universe's ranking_top, topk_mean_per_horizon_k15 is ranked higher with a score of 0.6538, but it's not in the current list. However, the current candidate topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is already there. Maybe adding other topk candidates with different k values? But the allowed edits can_add_candidates is true, so perhaps adding topk_mean_per_horizon_k15 or others. However, the user's current_candidate_names include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, which is already a top candidate. Alternatively, looking at the recommended knobs, maybe adjusting parameters like trim_ratio or l2, but the user can't change the method, only add/remove candidates.\n\nWait, the user's current candidates are baseline_mean, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. The tool's recommended knobs suggest trim_ratio 0.2, but the current candidates don't have that. However, in the valid_candidate_names, there's trimmed_mean_r0.20, which might be a candidate with trim_ratio 0.2. But the current candidates don't include that. However, the user can add candidates from the valid list. So maybe adding trimmed_mean_r0.20 or other candidates with trim_ratio 0.2. But the current candidates don't have that. Alternatively, the user might want to replace baseline_mean with a more stable candidate.\n\nLooking at the universe's leaderboards, robust_median has a lower RMSE, SMAPE, and MAPE. But robust_median isn't in the current candidates. However, the allowed_edits say can_add_candidates is true, so maybe adding robust_median. But the user's current candidates are limited, and the tool's recommended knobs might suggest using certain parameters. However, the user's task is to audit and suggest changes based on the tool's output.\n\nConsidering the stability of baseline_mean, it's marked as unstable. So removing it might be a good idea. Then, adding candidates that have better stability. For example, trimmed_mean_r0.15 is in the universe's ranking_top with a score of 0.6572, which is slightly lower than the current candidates but might be more stable. However, the current candidates have higher scores. Alternatively, maybe the current candidates are acceptable, but the baseline_mean is unstable and should be removed.\n\nSo, the plan is to remove baseline_mean because it's unstable, and add candidates that have better stability or higher scores. However, looking at the candidate_ranking_top, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is the top with 0.6746, then topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with 0.6705. So maybe keeping those and removing baseline_mean. The rationale would be that baseline_mean has high instability, and the other two are better performers. Also, the score margin between the top two is small, so maybe keeping both. But the user can only add or remove candidates from the current list. Since the current list includes baseline_mean, which is unstable, removing it would be a good change. The when_good would be when stability is a priority, and the rationale is that baseline_mean's high RMSE standard deviation makes it unstable.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [\"trimmed_mean_r0.20\"], \"remove_names\": [\"baseline_mean\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"trim_ratio\": 0.2, \"shrinkage\": 0.35}, \"rationale\": \"Baseline_mean shows high instability (rmse_std_over_rmse=0.497).

      "statistician": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to build a debate packet tool first, then return a JSON with specific keys. The current candidate names are \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", and \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\". The valid candidate names are a long list, but I can only use those provided.\n\nLooking at the tool response, the recommended knobs suggest using top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.2. The rationale is that with few windows (n_windows=3), stronger regularization/shrinkage is better. \n\nThe current candidates include \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" which has shrinkage 0.35, which matches the recommended shrinkage. The \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" has top_k=5, which aligns with the recommendation. The \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" has trim_ratio=0.2, which also matches. \n\nSo, the existing candidates already have the recommended parameters. The best candidate is \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" according to the best section. However, the stability flags indicate that \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" is unstable (rmse_std_over_rmse is 0.509). The recommended knobs might suggest using more stable methods. \n\nBut the current candidates are already following the recommended parameters. Since the user says not to change params.method, and the recommended knobs are already applied, maybe there's no need to add or remove candidates. The rationale would be that the recommended knobs are applied, and the when_good is \"Robust\" as per the rules. \n\nWait, but the stability is flagged as unstable. However, the tool's recommended knobs are based on few windows, so maybe it's acceptable. The user instruction says to prefer stability when n_windows is small. The current candidates might not be stable enough. But the tool's recommended knobs are already in use. \n\nHmm, maybe the existing candidates are the best under the recommended settings. Since the user says if uncertain, return the default. So the answer would be to keep the current candidates, apply the recommended knobs, and state that.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [], \"remove_names\": [], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"rationale\": \"Recommended knobs applied with top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, trim_ratio=0.2\", \"changes\": [], \"when_good\": \"Robust\"}"
