      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed decision.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best_per_horizon has some models winning in different horizons, like ONLY_FT_catboost and CWT_catboost. The disagreement metrics indicate high disagreement, so maybe strategies that handle disagreement well would be good.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, there are several options. The baseline_mean and robust_median are simple baselines. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and k8 are selection methods that take top models. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is a weighted approach. Also, there's ridge_stacking and some dynamic error methods.\n\nSince the validation has high disagreement, maybe using a weighted approach that combines multiple models could be better. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 seems relevant here. Also, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 might be a good choice as it averages the top models, which could mitigate the disagreement.\n\nThe score_preset is set to \"balanced\" by default, but maybe \"robust_smape\" could be considered if the user wants more focus on SMAPE. However, the example given uses \"balanced\", so perhaps that's safe.\n\nI need to make sure to select at least three candidates. Let's check the recommended_candidates list again. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and maybe the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Also, the baseline_mean as a conservative choice.\n\nWait, the example in the rules shows selecting topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 with top_k set to 7. But in the recommended_candidates, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5. So I need to use the parameters as provided. The user instruction says to set top_k explicitly if needed.\n\nSo, the selected_names could be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, maybe include the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the example only had two, but the rules say to prefer at least three. Let me check the candidate_library again.\n\nLooking at the candidate_library, there's a topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. Also, the baseline_mean. So selecting these three would be good. The rationale would be based on the high disagreement and the need for robust methods.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, top-k mean to handle high disagreement, and inverse-RMSE weights with shrinkage for adaptive weighting.
