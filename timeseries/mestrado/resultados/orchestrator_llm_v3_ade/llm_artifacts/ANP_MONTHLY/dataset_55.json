      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool response. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's a high disagreement among models. The recommended_knobs suggest candidates like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_single, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, and inverse_rmse_weights. Also, there's a ridge_stacking and some weighted averages.\n\nThe user's instruction says to select candidate names only from the candidate_library. The example given uses topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 with top_k set to 7. But in the current tool response, the recommended_candidates include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. However, the validation_summary's recommended_knobs has top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35. \n\nWait, the user's example had top_k=7, but in the current tool response, the recommended_candidates have top_k=5. So maybe I should use the top_k as per the recommended_knobs. The meta in recommended_knobs says top_k is 5. Also, the validation_summary's disagreement has a relative_spread_mean of 0.63, which is quite high. So maybe selecting a topk that's not too high to avoid instability but also not too low to include enough models.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, there's topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and topk_mean_per_horizon_k8. Since the disagreement is high, maybe using a higher k could be better to include more models. However, with only 3 windows, a higher k might be unstable. The example in the user's instruction used k=5, so maybe that's a safe choice here.\n\nAlso, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is recommended. The params_overrides need to set top_k if necessary. Since the candidate's params already have top_k=5, maybe no override is needed. But the user's example had top_k=7, which was set explicitly. However, in this case, the candidate's top_k is 5, so maybe just use that.\n\nThe score_preset can be \"balanced\" as per the example. The rationale should explain the selection based on high disagreement and the need for robustness. Also, considering the recommended_candidates, including baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_single, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, and inverse_rmse_weights.\n\nWait, the user's example had three candidates. The instructions say to prefer at least 3. So maybe select baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, check if the params_overrides are needed. Since the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, and the recommended_knobs says top_k=5, no override is needed. Similarly for inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, which already has top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35.\n\nSo the selected_names would be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. The score_preset is balanced. The rationale is that with high disagreement, using a trimmed mean and inverse RMSE weights with shrinkage helps balance performance and stability. Also, including the baseline for comparison.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for robustness, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 to leverage top-performing models, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 to weight models by inverse RMSE with shrinkage.
