      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some forecasting strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and others with inverse RMSE weights and ridge stacking.\n\nLooking at the candidate_library, there are a lot of options. The user's instructions say to select candidates by name from the candidate_library and set top_k if needed. The example shows using topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=7, but here the recommended_knobs have top_k=5. Wait, the tool's recommended_knobs have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=5, so maybe I should use that.\n\nThe score_presets include balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, and robust_smape. The user didn't specify a preset, so maybe default to balanced. Also, the example had \"Conservative selection\" rationale when unsure, but here I need to pick at least 3 candidates.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, there's baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, etc. Let's pick three. Maybe baseline_mean as a safe choice, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, check if they need top_k overrides. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 already has top_k=5, which matches the recommended_knobs. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 also has top_k=5. So no need to override unless specified. The rationale would be based on the validation_summary and recommended_knobs, selecting strategies that balance performance and stability.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for diversified averaging, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for adaptive weighting based on validation performance and recommended strategies.\"}"
