      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate names from the provided library and set parameters. First, I need to check the validation summary and recommended candidates.\n\nLooking at the validation_summary, there are 26 models with 3 windows and a horizon of 12. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among models. The recommended_knobs suggest candidates like baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, and inverse_rmse_weights. \n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I should focus on the recommended ones. The user mentioned selecting at least 3 candidates. The example shows using topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 with top_k set based on validation. \n\nSince the recommended_candidates include \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", I should consider those. Also, \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\" is a good selection. \n\nI need to ensure that any candidate with a top_k parameter has it explicitly set. The validation_summary's meta suggests top_k=5, so I'll use that. \n\nSo, selecting \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\". All these are in the recommended_candidates. The score_preset is balanced as per the example. No need for force_debate since there are multiple candidates. \n\nRationale: Chose top_k based on validation_summary and recommended_knobs.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected top-k based on validation_summary and recommended_knobs with top_k=5 for stability given 3 windows\"}",
      "skeptic": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to act as an auditor to evaluate the current candidates in the debate packet. The current candidates are \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", and \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\". The tool response provided a detailed validation summary, candidate rankings, and recommended knobs.\n\nFirst, I need to check if any of the current candidates should be removed or if new ones should be added. The tool's output shows that \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" is the best performer with the highest score. The \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\" has a lower score compared to the top candidate. The \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" is also in the top but slightly behind \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\".\n\nLooking at the per_horizon_winners, \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" wins more often in RMSE, SMAPE, and MAPE. The score margin between the top two candidates is small (0.0041), but \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" is still leading. However, the user's instruction says to reject strategies that use y_true from the same window being evaluated. Wait, the current candidates don't seem to be using y_true from the same window, but I need to ensure that.\n\nThe recommended knobs suggest using top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.2. The current candidates don't have these parameters. For example, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" has shrinkage 0.35, which matches the recommended. However, \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" is a selection method, not a weighted average. The \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\" is a selection method as well.\n\nThe tool's universe includes other candidates like \"trimmed_mean_r0.05\" and \"poly_weighted_average_p0.5_trim0.8\" which have better scores. But the user's current_candidate_names don't include these. However, the allowed_edits say that adding candidates is allowed. But the user's instruction says to only use names from valid_candidate_names. The valid_candidate_names include \"trimmed_mean_r0.05\" and others, but the current candidates don't have them. However, the user might not want to add them unless they are better.\n\nWait, the user's current_candidate_names are [\"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"]. The tool's universe has other candidates, but the user might not want to add them unless they are better. However, the tool's best candidate is \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", which is already in the current list. The next best is \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", which is also in the current list. The third is \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", which is in the list but has a lower score.\n\nThe stability flags for \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" show that it's not unstable. The recommended knobs suggest parameters that might be used in other candidates, but since the current candidates are already using some of them (like shrinkage 0.35), maybe there's no need to change parameters. However, the user's instruction says not to change params.method, so I can't adjust the method, only the parameters if allowed. But the allowed_edits mention that params_allowed include top_k, trim_ratio, shrinkage, l2. However, the current candidates don't have these parameters. For example, \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" uses top_k=5, which matches the recommended. The \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" has shrinkage 0.35, which is also recommended. So maybe the current parameters are already aligned with the recommendations.\n\nSince the current candidates are already the top performers according to the tool's output, and there's no evidence that they use y_true from the same window (which would be a leak), I should not remove any. However, the user's instruction says to reject strategies that use y_true from the same window. The current candidates are selection methods (best_per_horizon, topk_mean) and inverse_rmse_weights, which are weighted averages. None of these seem to use y_true from the same window as the evaluation. Therefore, they are valid.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that no changes are needed. The current candidates are the best, and they don't have leakage. Therefore, the JSON output should indicate no changes.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [], \"remove_names\": [], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"rationale\": \"Current candidates are top performers with no evidence of leakage. 'topk_mean_per_horizon_k5' leads in aggregate score, 'inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35' and 'best_per_horizon_by_validation' show competitive performance.

      "statistician": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to build a debate packet tool first, then return a JSON with specific keys. The current candidate names are \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", and \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\". The valid candidate names include various models like ade_dynamic_error, exp_weighted_average, inverse_rmse_weights, etc.\n\nLooking at the tool response, the recommended knobs suggest top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.2. The rationale is that with few windows (n_windows=3), stronger regularization/shrinkage is needed. \n\nThe current candidates include \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" which aligns with the recommended top_k=5. However, the shrinkage parameter in the current candidates is 0.35 (from \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"), which matches the recommended shrinkage. But the trim_ratio in the current candidates isn't explicitly mentioned, so maybe we need to adjust that. However, the allowed edits mention trim_ratio can be between 0.0 and 0.4, so maybe the existing candidates don't have that parameter, so we might need to add a candidate with trim_ratio=0.2. But looking at the valid_candidate_names, there's \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" which has a trim ratio of 0.2. \n\nThe current candidates don't include \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\", so maybe adding that would be beneficial based on the recommended knobs. Also, the existing \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" has shrinkage=0.35, which is good, but maybe we should check if there's a candidate with l2=50.0. Looking at the valid_candidate_names, there's \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk3\" and \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\". The current candidates don't have these, so adding them might help with the l2 regularization.\n\nHowever, the user's current_candidate_names are limited, and the allowed edits say we can add candidates. The recommended knobs suggest l2=50.0, so adding \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" (since top_k is 5) might be a good idea. Also, the trim_ratio is 0.2, so adding \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" could be beneficial.\n\nBut wait, the current_candidate_names include \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" which is a topk method. The recommended knobs also mention top_k=5, so that's already covered. However, the existing candidates don't have the l2=50.0 or trim_ratio=0.2. So adding \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" and \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" might improve the model's robustness by incorporating the recommended parameters.\n\nBut the user's allowed edits say can_add_candidates is true, so adding those would be allowed. However, the current_candidate_names don't include those, so they need to be added. Also, the existing \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" has shrinkage=0.35, which matches the recommended shrinkage. \n\nSo, the plan is to add \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\" (for l2=50.0 and top_k=5) and \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\" (for trim_ratio=0.2). Also, check if there are any candidates to remove. The current candidates are \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", and \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\". The recommended knobs might suggest that \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\" is not as good as the others, but the tool's candidate_ranking_top shows that \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" is the best. However, the user might not want to remove existing candidates unless there's a reason. Since the rationale says to prefer stability when n_windows is small, and the existing candidates might be stable, maybe we shouldn't remove them. \n\nSo, the final answer would be to add the two new candidates and keep the existing ones, with the rationale based on the recommended knobs.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [\"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\", \"trimmed_mean_r0.20\"], \"remove_names\": [], \"params_overrides\": {\"top_k\": 5, \"shrinkage\": 0.35, \"l2\": 50.0, \"trim_ratio\": 0.2}, \"rationale\": \"Recommended knobs applied for few windows (n_windows=3): top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.2 to improve stability and robustness.\", \"changes\": [\"Added ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 (l2=50.0, top_k=5) and trimmed_mean_r0.20 (trim_ratio=0.2) per recommended knobs\"], \"when_good\": \"Robust\"}"
