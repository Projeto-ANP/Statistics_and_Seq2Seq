      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by looking at the validation summary and the recommended candidates. The user wants me to select some candidates based on the provided tool output.\n\nFirst, the validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and others with inverse RMSE weights and ridge stacking.\n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I need to pick those that are in the recommended_candidates list. The user mentioned to prefer at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there's baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, topk_mean_per_horizon_k8, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0.\n\nI should select a mix of baseline, selection, and weighted methods. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 seem good as they are recommended. Also, the ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is a stacking method which might perform well. Including the baseline_mean as a conservative choice makes sense. \n\nFor the score_preset, the balanced preset is a good default. The rationale should explain the selection based on the validation results and recommended candidates. I need to make sure that any top_k parameters are set explicitly. Since the recommended top_k is 5 for some candidates, I'll set that in params_overrides if needed. However, looking at the params in the recommended_candidates, they already have top_k set, so maybe no overrides are necessary unless specified. \n\nWait, the user instruction says to set top_k explicitly via params_overrides for any candidate whose params include top_k. The recommended_candidates have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=5, so maybe no override is needed. But if there's a need to adjust, but the example shows setting it. However, in this case, since the candidate's params already have top_k, maybe it's okay. \n\nSo the selected_names would be baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. That's five candidates. The score_preset is balanced. The rationale is that these candidates are recommended and cover different strategies.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected recommended candidates covering baseline, per-horizon selection, top-k averaging, inverse-RMSE weighting, and ridge stacking strategies to balance robustness and adaptability given the validation results.\"}"
