      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided validation summary and candidate library. First, I need to make sure I only use the names from the candidate_library. The validation_summary shows that there's high disagreement among models, with a relative spread mean of 0.38 and p90 of 0.53. Also, there are some models that perform well in specific horizons.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, there are several options. The baseline_mean and robust_median are simple baselines. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and k8 are selection methods that take top models by RMSE. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and k8_sh0.35 are weighted methods. There's also ridge_stacking and some exponential/polynomial weighted averages.\n\nSince there's high disagreement, maybe a method that combines multiple models would be better. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 seems reasonable, but the recommended_knobs suggest using top_k=5. However, the validation_summary's best_per_horizon has unique winners, so maybe a per-horizon approach is better. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is in the recommended_candidates. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 might be good as it uses shrinkage to avoid overfitting. The ridge_stacking could be another option, but with only 3 windows, it might be unstable.\n\nI should select at least three candidates. Let's pick baseline_mean for simplicity, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for combining top models, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for weighted averaging. The score_preset could be balanced as it's a general approach. Need to check if the params_overrides are needed. For the topk_mean, the top_k is already set to 5 in the candidate, so no override needed. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 also has the parameters set. So the selected_names would be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. The rationale is that these methods balance simplicity, top model selection, and weighted averaging to handle high disagreement.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for robustness, top-k mean to leverage top-performing models, and inverse-RMSE weights with shrinkage to handle high disagreement while avoiding overfitting.\"}"
