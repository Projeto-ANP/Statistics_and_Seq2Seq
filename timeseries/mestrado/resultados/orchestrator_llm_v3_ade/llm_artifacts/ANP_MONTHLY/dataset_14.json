      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others. \n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I should focus on the ones recommended. The user mentioned selecting at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there's baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0.\n\nI need to make sure the selected names are from the candidate_library. The example given used topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, the params_overrides should set top_k if needed. The score_preset can be balanced, rmse_focus, direction_focus, or robust_smape. \n\nSince the validation_summary's disagreement is moderate (relative_spread_mean is 0.1377), maybe a balanced approach is safe. The recommended_candidates include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. These are all valid. Also, best_per_horizon_by_validation is a good selection. \n\nI should select at least three. Let's pick baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. But wait, the example had two topk and inverse_rmse. Maybe include inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 as well. However, the user said to prefer at least three. Let me check the recommended_candidates again. The recommended_candidates list includes baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, etc. \n\nSo, selecting three: best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, check if they have top_k parameters. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has top_k=5. The params_overrides would need to set top_k if they are using a different value, but in this case, the recommended ones already have top_k=5, so maybe no overrides needed. \n\nWait, the user's example had explicit top_k. But in the recommended_candidates, the topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 already has top_k=5. So maybe no need to override. However, the tool's output has a meta with top_k=5. So, the params_overrides might not be necessary here. \n\nSo, the selected_names would be best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. The score_preset could be balanced. The rationale would be that these candidates balance between selection and weighted averaging, leveraging past validation performance and robustness against outliers.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected top-performing strategies that balance model selection (best_per_horizon), ensemble robustness (topk_mean_per_horizon_k5), and inverse-RMSE weighting with shrinkage (inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35) based on validation performance and recommended knobs.\"}"
