    "raw": {
      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others. \n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I should focus on the ones recommended. The user mentioned selecting at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there's baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0.\n\nI need to make sure I only use names from the candidate_library. The example given used topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, setting top_k explicitly. The validation_summary's recommended_knobs suggest top_k=5. The meta in recommended_candidates has top_k=5, so maybe I should use that. \n\nAlso, the score_preset can be set based on the user's needs. The example used \"balanced\". Since the user didn't specify, maybe default to \"balanced\". \n\nI need to check if any parameters need overriding. For example, if a candidate requires top_k, I should set it. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 already has top_k=5, so maybe no override needed. However, the example had params_overrides with top_k=7, but in this case, the recommended is 5. \n\nWait, the recommended_candidates include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=5, so that's already set. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 also has top_k=5. So maybe those are okay as is. \n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. But the user said at least 3. Let me pick three. Maybe the top ones from the recommended list. \n\nThe rationale should explain the selection. Since the validation has some disagreement, using a combination of baseline, topk, and inverse_rmse might be good. Also, the score_preset is balanced. \n\nI need to make sure not to include any candidates not in the library. The example had \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" and \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", which are in the candidate_library. \n\nSo, the final selection could be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, maybe include best_per_horizon_by_validation. But the user said at least 3. Let me check the example again. The example had two candidates, but the user said to prefer at least 3. \n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, there are several. Let me pick three: baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5. Then, maybe add inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 as a fourth. \n\nBut the user might want a balanced approach. The score_preset is \"balanced\" as per the example. So, the JSON would include selected_names with those candidates, params_overrides if needed, and the rationale.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline, per-horizon best model selection, top-5 mean, and inverse-RMSE weighted averaging to balance robustness and adaptability across horizons with moderate shrinkage\"}",
      "skeptic": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to act as an anti-leakage skeptic/auditor. The main task is to evaluate the current candidates and decide whether to add, remove, or adjust parameters based on the provided debate packet tool results.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the current_candidate_names: [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\"]. The tool's output shows the rankings and scores for these candidates. \n\nLooking at the candidate_ranking_top, the top two are inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with very close scores (difference is 0.000588). The baseline_mean and best_per_horizon_by_validation have lower scores. \n\nThe recommended_knobs suggest that with few windows, stronger regularization/shrinkage is better. The current candidate inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has shrinkage 0.35, which aligns with the recommendation. However, the tool's universe includes other inverse_rmse_weights candidates with different parameters. For example, inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.70 has a higher score in the universe's ranking. But wait, the allowed_edits say can_add_candidates is true, but the current candidates don't include those. However, the user's instruction says I can only add candidates from the valid_candidate_names. The valid_candidate_names include various inverse_rmse_weights with different k and shrinkage values. \n\nBut the current candidates are inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. The tool's universe ranking shows that inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.70 has a lower score (0.528) compared to the current best (0.538). So maybe adding those isn't beneficial. However, the score difference is small. But the user's instruction says to only use candidates from the valid list. \n\nWait, the current candidates are in the valid_candidate_names. The tool's output shows that the best candidate in the universe is inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.70, but it's not in the current_candidate_names. However, the allowed_edits allow adding candidates. But the user's instruction says I can only add candidates from the valid_candidate_names. So maybe I should consider adding other candidates that are in the valid list and might perform better. \n\nBut looking at the per_horizon_winners, the current candidates are performing well. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is in the top for several metrics. However, the score margin between the top two is very small. The tool's recommended_knobs suggest that the current shrinkage (0.35) is appropriate. \n\nThe stability flags for the best candidate show that it's not unstable. The RMSE_std_over_RMSE is 0.069, which is under 10%, so it's stable. \n\nNow, considering the allowed_edits, can I adjust parameters? The params_allowed include top_k, trim_ratio, shrinkage, l2. But the current candidates are using specific parameters. For example, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 has k=5 and shrinkage=0.35. The recommended_knobs suggest top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, which matches the current candidate. So maybe no parameter changes are needed. \n\nThe user's instruction says not to change params.method. So I can't change the method, only parameters. But the current candidates are already using the recommended parameters. \n\nLooking at the per_horizon_winners, the current candidates are leading in most metrics. The baseline_mean and best_per_horizon_by_validation have lower scores. So maybe removing them would be beneficial. The rationale would be that they have lower scores compared to the top candidates. \n\nSo, the plan is: remove the baseline_mean and best_per_horizon_by_validation since they are underperforming. Add any candidates from the valid list that might perform better, but looking at the universe's top candidates, inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.70 is better, but it's not in the current list. However, the allowed_edits allow adding candidates. But the user's instruction says to only add from valid_candidate_names. Since inverse_rmse_weights_k8_sh0.70 is in the valid_candidate_names, maybe adding it would help. However, the current best is inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. The score difference is small, but maybe adding other candidates could improve the ensemble. However, the tool's output doesn't show that adding them would improve the current setup. \n\nAlternatively, since the current candidates are already performing well, maybe no additions are needed. The user's instruction says to only add if they are from the valid list. But without more data, it's safer to not add unless there's a clear benefit. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is to remove the underperforming candidates (baseline_mean and best_per_horizon_by_validation) and keep the current top ones. No parameter changes are needed since the current parameters align with the recommendations. The rationale is that the current top candidates have higher scores and better stability.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [], \"remove_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"rationale\": \"Current top candidates (inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5) outperform baseline_mean and best_per_horizon_by_validation by 0.000588 score margin.

      "statistician": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to build a debate packet using the provided tool and then return a JSON with specific keys. The current candidates are \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" and \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\". The tool's response has a lot of data, including validation summaries, candidate rankings, and recommended knobs.\n\nFirst, I need to check the recommended knobs. The \"recommended_knobs\" section says \"few_windows => stronger regularization/shrinkage\" and suggests top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35, l2=50.0, trim_ratio=0.1. Since the current candidates already have top_k=5 and shrinkage=0.35 (for inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35), maybe those are already aligned with the recommendations. However, the trim_ratio in the current candidates isn't mentioned here, but the recommended trim_ratio is 0.1. But the current candidates might not have that parameter. Wait, the current candidates are inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 (which has shrinkage 0.35) and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 (which is a top-k method, not inverse RMSE weighted). \n\nLooking at the allowed edits, the user can add or remove candidates. The recommended knobs might suggest adding other candidates that fit the parameters. For example, the recommended trim_ratio is 0.1, but the current candidates don't have that. However, the valid_candidate_names include \"trimmed_mean_r0.10\" and others. But the user's current candidates don't include those. However, the user might want to stick with the current candidates if they are already aligned with the recommended knobs.\n\nThe candidate rankings show that the top two are inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, with a very small score margin. The stability flags for inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 show that it's not unstable (unstable: false). The recommended knobs suggest using top_k=5, which matches the current topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 (k=5). The shrinkage of 0.35 is already in the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 candidate. \n\nSince the user's current candidates are already following the recommended knobs (top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35), maybe there's no need to add or remove candidates. However, the tool's response also includes other candidates in the universe that might be better. But the user's instruction says to only use candidates from valid_candidate_names and not invent names. The allowed edits allow adding candidates, but the rationale might suggest that the current ones are sufficient. \n\nThe \"rationale\" in the recommended_knobs is \"few_windows => stronger regularization/shrinkage\", which the current candidates already have. Therefore, maybe the best action is to keep the current candidates and not add or remove any. The changes array would be empty, and the rationale would be that the recommended knobs are already applied. The when_good would be \"Robust\" since the stability is considered.\n</think>\n\n{\"add_names\": [], \"remove_names\": [], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"rationale\": \"Recommended knobs (top_k=5, shrinkage=0.35) already aligned with current candidates.
