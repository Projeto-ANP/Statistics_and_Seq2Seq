      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some multi-step combination strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others. \n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I need to pick those that are in the recommended_candidates list. The user mentioned to select at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there's baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim1.0, poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim1.0, and ade_dynamic_error_beta0.5_trim1.0.\n\nI should choose a few of these. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is recommended with top_k=5. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 also uses top_k=5. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 uses top_k=5 as well. The exp_weighted_average and poly_weighted_average have their parameters set. \n\nI need to make sure to set the top_k parameter explicitly for any candidate that requires it. Since the recommended_knobs suggest top_k=5 for some, I'll use that. Also, the score_preset can be \"balanced\" as per the example. \n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and ridge_stacking_l250_topk5. That's four candidates. I'll set their parameters as needed. The rationale would be that these candidates balance different approaches: a baseline, top-k averaging, inverse RMSE weighting, and ridge stacking, which should cover various aspects of model combination.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected diverse strategies: baseline averaging, top-k mean, inverse RMSE weighting, and ridge stacking.
