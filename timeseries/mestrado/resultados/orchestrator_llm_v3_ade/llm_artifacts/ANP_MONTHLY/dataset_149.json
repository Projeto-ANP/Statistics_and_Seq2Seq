      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed choice.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, indicating high disagreement among models. The relative spread of errors is around 0.7675 on average, with some horizons having higher spreads. This suggests that the models don't agree much, so maybe a strategy that combines multiple models would be better than selecting a single one.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, there are several options. The baseline_mean and robust_median are simple aggregations. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and k8 average the top models per horizon. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 uses weights based on RMSE with shrinkage. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 is a stacking method, and the exp_weighted_average_eta1.0_trim0.8 and poly_weighted_average_p1.0_trim0.8 are other weighting strategies.\n\nSince the models have high disagreement, using a combination of top models might help. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 is recommended with top_k=5. Also, the inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 could be good as it uses inverse RMSE with shrinkage to avoid overfitting. The ridge_stacking might be another option, but with only 3 windows, it might be unstable. The exp_weighted and poly_weighted averages could also be considered, but they might be sensitive to parameters.\n\nI should select a few candidates that use different approaches. Maybe baseline_mean as a conservative choice, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, check if the params_overrides are needed. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 in the recommended_candidates has top_k=5, which matches the meta's top_k=5, so no override needed. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 also has the correct parameters. The score_preset could be \"balanced\" as it's a general approach. Force_debate is false unless there's a big difference in scores, but with the given info, it's safer to not force debate. The rationale would mention the high disagreement and selection of combination strategies.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected combination strategies to handle high model disagreement (relative_spread_mean=0.7675) and heterogeneous horizons.
