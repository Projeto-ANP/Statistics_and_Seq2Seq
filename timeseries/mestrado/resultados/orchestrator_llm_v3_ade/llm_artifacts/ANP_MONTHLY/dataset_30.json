      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed choice.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, indicating some heterogeneity. The disagreement metrics are high, so maybe strategies that handle disagreement well would be good. The recommended_candidates include baseline_mean, robust_median, trimmed_mean, best_single, best_per_horizon, topk_mean, inverse_rmse_weights, ridge_stacking, exp_weighted_average, and poly_weighted_average.\n\nSince the user mentioned high disagreement, maybe selecting a few robust methods. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 are recommended. Also, the baseline_mean is a safe choice. Let me check the params_overrides. For topk_mean, the top_k is set to 5, which is in the recommended_candidates. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 also has shrinkage 0.35. \n\nI should select at least three candidates. Maybe baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, considering the score_preset, balanced is a good default. No need for force_debate since the margin is 0.02, but the user might prefer a conservative approach. Let me make sure the names are in the candidate_library. Yes, those names are present. Alright, that should cover it.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, top-k mean for handling disagreement, and inverse-RMSE weights with shrinkage to balance model contributions based on validation performance\"}"
