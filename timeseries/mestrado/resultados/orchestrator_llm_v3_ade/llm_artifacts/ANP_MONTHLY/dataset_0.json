      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed choice.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, indicating high disagreement among models. The disagreement metrics have a relative spread mean of ~0.49 and a 90th percentile of 0.63. This suggests that the models don't agree much, so maybe a strategy that combines multiple models would be better than selecting a single one.\n\nLooking at the recommended_candidates, there are several options. The baseline_mean and robust_median are simple baselines. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and k8 are selection methods that take the top models by RMSE. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 and others are weighted methods. There's also ridge_stacking and some dynamic error weighting methods.\n\nSince the models have high disagreement, using a combination approach like topk_mean or inverse_rmse_weights might be better. The recommended_candidates include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. Also, the score_preset is set to \"balanced\" by default, which weights RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID equally.\n\nI should select a few candidates that use different strategies. Maybe include a baseline, a topk_mean, and a weighted method. The user mentioned to prefer at least 3 candidates. Let's check the candidate_library for available names. The recommended_candidates list includes \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\", and \"ridge_stacking_l250_topk5\". These are all valid and fit the criteria.\n\nI need to make sure to set the top_k parameter for any candidate that requires it. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 already has top_k=5, so no override needed. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 also has top_k=5. The ridge_stacking_l250_topk5 has top_k=5 as well. So, no params_overrides are necessary here.\n\nThe score_preset is \"balanced\" as per the example. Force_debate is false unless there's a need for it, but with the given info, it's safe to leave it as false. The rationale should explain the selection based on high disagreement and the need for combination strategies.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for stability, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for robust aggregation of top models, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 to leverage weighted ensemble with shrinkage.
