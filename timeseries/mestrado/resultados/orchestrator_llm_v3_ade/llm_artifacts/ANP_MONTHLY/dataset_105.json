      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to propose some forecasting strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation summary and the candidate library.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, and there's some disagreement among them. The recommended_knobs include several candidates like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and others with inverse RMSE weights and ridge stacking.\n\nThe candidate_library has a lot of options, but I should focus on the recommended ones. The user mentioned selecting at least 3 candidates. Looking at the recommended_candidates, there's baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, ridge_stacking_l250_topk5, and others. \n\nI need to make sure to use the names from the candidate_library. The score_preset can be set based on the user's needs, but since they didn't specify, maybe \"balanced\" is a safe choice. Also, the params_overrides should include top_k for any candidates that require it. For example, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 already has top_k=5, but if there's a need to adjust, but the recommended_knobs suggest using k=5. \n\nWait, the user's example shows that if top_k is specified in the params, it should be set explicitly. In the recommended_candidates, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5, so maybe no override is needed. However, the validation_summary's meta says top_k is 5, so that's consistent.\n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 as the initial candidates. Also, maybe include inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 since it's in the recommended list. But the user wants at least 3, so maybe three is okay. \n\nCheck if the selected names are in the candidate_library. Yes, they are. The score_preset is \"balanced\" as per the example. The rationale would be that these candidates are recommended and cover different approaches: baseline, selection, and weighted averaging.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"best_per_horizon_by_validation\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline, per-horizon best model selection, top-k mean, and inverse-RMSE weighted averaging strategies based on validation performance and diversity of approaches.\"}"
