      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate strategies based on the provided tool output. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed choice.\n\nThe validation_summary shows that there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best models per horizon vary, indicating some heterogeneity. The disagreement metric has a high relative spread, so maybe strategies that handle disagreement well would be good. The recommended_candidates include baseline methods like mean and median, trimmed mean, selection methods like best_single and topk_mean, and weighted methods like inverse_rmse_weights and ridge stacking.\n\nThe user's example used topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k set to 7, but here the recommended_candidates have topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 with top_k=5. Since the validation has 3 windows, maybe a lower top_k is better to avoid instability. The inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 is also recommended, which uses shrinkage. \n\nLooking at the score_presets, \"balanced\" gives equal weight to RMSE, SMAPE, MAPE, and POCID. Since the user didn't specify a preset, maybe \"balanced\" is a safe choice. The example had force_debate as false, so unless there's a need for debate, it's probably best to leave it as false.\n\nI should select at least 3 candidates. From the recommended_candidates, baseline_mean, robust_median, and topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 are good choices. Also, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 could be included. However, the example had three candidates, so maybe stick to that. Let me check the candidate_library to ensure the names are correct. Yes, \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\" is present. Also, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\" is in the library. \n\nNeed to make sure to set top_k explicitly for any candidate that requires it. The topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 has top_k=5 as per the params, so no override needed unless the validation suggests a different value. Since the example used top_k=7, but here the recommended is 5, maybe keep it as is. \n\nSo the selected_names could be baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. The score_preset is balanced. No need for force_debate unless the scores are very close. The rationale would be choosing these based on the validation and recommended strategies.\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline for robustness, topk_mean for horizon-specific aggregation, and inverse_rmse_weights to leverage model performance differences\"}"
