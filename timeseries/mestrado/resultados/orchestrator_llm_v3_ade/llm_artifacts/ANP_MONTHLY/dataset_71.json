      "proposer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to select candidate names from the provided library and set the score_preset. First, I need to look at the validation_summary and recommended_knobs to make an informed choice.\n\nLooking at the validation_summary, there are 26 models and 3 windows. The best_per_horizon shows that different models win in different horizons, which suggests that a method that adapts per horizon might be good. The disagreement metrics have a relative spread mean of around 0.22, which isn't extremely high, but there's some variation. The recommended_candidates include several options like baseline_mean, best_per_horizon_by_validation, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, and others.\n\nThe user's example shows selecting candidates with explicit top_k parameters. Since the recommended_candidates include topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35, those could be good choices. Also, the baseline_mean is a safe option. The score_preset is set to \"balanced\" in the example, which is probably a good default unless there's a reason to choose another.\n\nI should check if the top_k values are set appropriately. The recommended_knobs mention top_k=5, so using that makes sense. The rationale would be based on the validation_summary and recommended_knobs, maybe mentioning the number of models and windows, and the choice of top_k. Since there are 26 models and 3 windows, using a top_k of 5 might balance diversity and stability.\n\nSo, selecting baseline_mean, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35. The score_preset is balanced. The rationale would be that these candidates are recommended, using top_k=5 as suggested, and balancing different approaches (baseline, top-k mean, inverse RMSE weights).\n</think>\n\n{\"selected_names\": [\"baseline_mean\", \"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\", \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\"], \"params_overrides\": {\"topk_mean_per_horizon_k5\": {\"top_k\": 5}, \"inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35\": {\"top_k\": 5}}, \"score_preset\": \"balanced\", \"force_debate\": false, \"debate_margin\": 0.02, \"rationale\": \"Selected baseline_mean for robustness, topk_mean_per_horizon_k5 for diversity, and inverse_rmse_weights_k5_sh0.35 for adaptive weighting.
